            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For the inſtrument of reaſon, the braine, being either not of well tempered ſubſtance: or diſordered in his parts: all exerciſe of wiſedome is hindred: and where once vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lodged, wit, memorie, &amp; quick

The dayly experience of phrenſies, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lunaſies, and melancholy cured by this heauenly gift of God, make manifeſt demonſtration hereof. The notable fruit &amp; ſucceſſe of which art in that kinde, hath cauſed ſome to iudge more baſely of the ſoule, then agreeth with pietie or nature, &amp; haue accompted all maner affection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be ſubiect to the phiſicians ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, not conſidering herein any thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and aboue the ordinarie euents, and naturall courſe of thinges: but haue eſteemed the vertues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, yea religion, no other thing but as the body hath ben tempered, and on the other ſide, vice, prophaneneſſe, &amp; neglect of religion and honeſtie, to haue bene nought elſe but a fault of humour.

I haue layd open howe the bodie, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things affect the ſoule, &amp; how the body is affected of it againe: what the difference is betwixt natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, and that heauy hande of God vpon the afflicted conſcience, tormented with remorſe of ſinne, &amp; feare of his iudgement: with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to my skill for ſuch as faint vnder that heauie burthen. And that I might to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of my endeuor (as other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:6813:4"/>wold permit me) comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that eſtate moſt comfortles, I haue added mine aduiſe of phiſicke helpe: what diet, what medicine, and what other remedie is meete for perſons, oppreſſed with melancholie feare, &amp; that kind of heauineſſe of hart. I haue enterlaced my treatiſe beſides with diſputes of Philoſophie that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſort of them, and ſuch as are of quicke conceit, &amp; delited in diſcourſe of reaſon in naturall things, may find to paſſe their time with, and knowe the grounds and reaſons of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, without which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue more diſcomfort, and greater cauſe of error. This I haue deliuered in a ſimple phraſe without any coſt, or port of words to a ſuppoſed frend <hi>M.</hi> not ignorant of good letters, that the diſcourſe might be more familiar then if it had caried other direction it otherwiſe would be. Chaunge the letter, and it is indifferent to whome
<pb facs="tcp:6813:5"/>ſoeuer ſtandeth in need, or ſhal make vſe thereof. I write it in our mother tong that the benefit (how ſmall ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be) might be more common, &amp; as the practiſe of all auncient phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers hath ben to write in their owne language their precepts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning nature, or touching maners of life, to the end their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men might reape the benefite with more eaſe, and ſeeke rather for ſound iudgement of vnderſtanding, then for vaine oſtentation of ſtrange tongs: which is alſo after a ſort fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in tranſlations: ſo I tooke it meeteſt to impart theſe fewe poyntes of philoſophie, &amp; phiſicke in Engliſh to the end our people, as other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do, might acquaint them ſelues with ſome part of this kinde, rather then with other friuolous diſcourſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable to vſe, nor delectable to the vertuous, and well diſpoſed minde.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE I enter to define the nature of melancholie, &amp; what it is, for the cleare vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of that wherein my purpoſe is to inſtruct you, it ſhall be neceſſarie to lay forth diuerſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of takinge the name of melancholie, and whereto the name being one, is applied diuerſlie. It ſignifieth in all, either a certayne fearefull diſpoſition of the mind altered from reaſon, or elſe an humour of the body, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly taken to be the only cauſe of reaſon by feare in ſuch ſort depraued. This hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is of two ſorts: naturall, or vnnaturall: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall is either the groſſer part of the bloud or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6813:14"/>for nouriſhment, which either by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or immoderate hoteneſſe, paſſing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſurchargeth the bodie, and yeeldeth vp to the braine certaine vapors, whereby the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is obſcured; or elſe is an excrement or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be auoyded out of the bodie, through ſo manie alterations of naturall heate, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of concoction, hauing not a drop of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing iuyce remaining, whereby the bodie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in power or ſubſtance may be relieued. This excrement, if it keepeth the bounds of his owne nature, breedeth leſſe perturbance either to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or minde: if it corrupt and degenerate far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from it ſelfe and the qualitie of the bodie; then are all paſſions more vehement, &amp; ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly oppreſſe and trouble the quiet ſeate of the mind, that all organicall actions therof are mixed with melancholie madneſſe; and reaſon turned to a vaine feare, or plaine deſperation, the braine being altered in his complexion, and as it were tranſported into an inſtrument of an other make then it was firſt ordained: theſe two according to the diuerſitie of ſetling, do ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diuerſitie of paſſions, &amp; according therunto do diuerſlie affect the vnderſtanding, &amp; do alter the affection, eſpecially if by corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or euill cuſtome of manners the partie be ouer paſſionate. The vnnaturall is an humour riſing of melancholie before mentioned, or elſe from bloud or choler, whollie chaunged into an other nature by an vnkindly he ate, which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe humours, which before were raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnder natures gouernment, and kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6813:14"/>into a qualitie whollie repugnant, whoſe ſubſtance and vapor giueth ſuch annoyance to all the partes, that as it paſſeth or is ſeated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſtrange alterations in our actions, whether they be animal or voluntarie, or naturall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon our will, and theſe are all which the name of melancholie doth ſignifie: now the definition and what it is. As the thinges be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, ſo it alſo followeth the ſuite, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diuerſe either of the humour or of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the humour being either a nutritiue iuyce or an excrement vnprofitable thereunto, I define the humor no otherwiſe then that part of that bloud which naturally of the reſt is moſt groſſe; and the excrement the ſuperfluitie of the ſame; which if it putrifieth, beſtoweth ſtill the name of a farre diuerſe thing both in temper &amp; nature, called blacke choller. The melancholie paſſion is a doting of reaſon through vaine feare procured by fault of the melancholie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Thus brieflie &amp; clearly do you vnderſtand what the nature of melancholie is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name is vſually applied: of which when I ſhall haue at the full to your contentment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, then will I ſatisfie the other part of your demaund, and lay open the conſent and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the conſcience oppreſſed with ſence of ſinne and this naturall kinde before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>AS all naturall humours riſe of nouriſhment, ſo melancholie being a part of bloud, from thence it ſpringeth alſo. Whatſoeuer we receaue into the bodie for ſuſtentation of this fraile life, conſiſteth of diuerſitie of partes, being it ſelfe compounded, although to the outward viewe it ſeemeth to appeare vniforme: as bread, fleſh, fiſh, milke, wine, beare &amp;c. which ſhewe of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie being taken away by the naturall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, which preſerueth the liuely heate of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie liuing thing, that outward reſemblance vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and the diuerſitie manifeſteth it ſelfe: as we ſee gold or ſiluer, before it be proued with fire appeareth no other then all alike: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward is diſcouered by the burning crucible to be much otherwiſe; ſo fareth it with nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe diuerſe partes are layd open by ſo manifold concoctions, and cleanſings, and ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, as are continually without intermiſſion practized of nature in euerie mans bodie: no gold finer, more buſie at the mine, or artificiall Chymiſt halfe ſo induſtrious in his laboratorie, as this naturall Chymiſt is in ſuch preparations of all nouriſhment: be it meat, or drinke, of what ſort ſoeuer. By this meanes the bloud which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in all parts like it ſelfe, no egge liker one to another, is preſerued diſtinct in all partes. The pureſt part which we call in compariſon and in reſpect of the reſt bloud, is temperate in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6813:15"/>and moderate in ſubſtance, exceeding all the other parts in quantitie, if the bodie be of equall temper, made for nouriſhment of the moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate parts, and ingendring of ſpirits. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is fleume, next to bloud in quantitie, of a waterie nature, cold and moyſt, apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the ſubſtance of purebloud if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture faile not in her workinge ordained for nouriſhment of moyſter partes. The thirde is melancholie, of ſubſtance groſſe and earthie, cold and drie in regard of the other, in quantity inferiour to fleume, fit nouriſhment for ſuch partes as are of like temper. The fourth, choler, fierie, hote, and drieſt of qualitie, thinne in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; leaſt in quantitie, and ordained for ſuch parts as require ſubtiller nouriſhment, and are tempered with greater portion of the fierie ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe differences nature hath ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, that although in veine and place, they remaine linked together, yet in facultie, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue they are diuerſe the one from the other: which as they fit the varietie of parts, bloud the temperate, and the reſt ſuch partes as haue like declining from temperate: ſo by the maruelous working of nature, theſe varieties of humours are entertained by nouriſhmentes inclining to like diſpoſition: although no nouriſhment can be vtterly voide of all theſe parts, no not thoſe that are counted moſt to encline to any one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as beefe, and veneſon to melancholie: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and butter, to choler: and fiſh to fleume. Hereof riſeth then this humour melancholie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from nouriſhments, as all the humours do;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6813:16"/>and although not of ſuch excellent vſe; yet as neceſſarie for the maintenance of life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bodie as anie other; neither do theſe humoures fall into mans nature onely: but what ſoeuer liuing creature hath bloud can not be deſtitute of them as partes thereof, more or leſſe according to their diuerſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Thus then as man conſiſteth of partes requiring this diuerſitie of foode, neceſſarie it was, and ſo ordained by God, ſuch humours might aunſwer in like varietie: and as humours are diuerſe; ſo likewiſe the matter whereof they ſhould be wrought could not be of one ſort, and therefore all kinde of nature ordained for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, affoord this choyce, ſome in greater ſcarſitie, this or that, to the end no ſtate of body ſhould complaine. Here you may moue a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not impertinent to the matter in hande; whether ſome bodies do not turne good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, &amp; of the pureſt ſort into greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of melancholie, then other ſome, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of nouriſhment which of it ſelfe would yeeldſtore of the beſt iuyce, by melancholicke or rather cold and drie diſpoſition of the bodie, can ſo be altered as to faile of that ſtore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by nature it is repleniſhed, and in ſteede thereof yeeld this groſſe, thicke, cold, &amp; earthie humour, whereof I nowe diſcourſe. Againe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe humours are in ſuch natures, as yeeld nouriſhment, and ſo by ſeparation only after any Anaxagorian manner appeare, or rather are made as a ſtoole out of timber, bread of corne, wine of grape, &amp;c.</p>

To theſe probabilities may be added, how ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures chaunge into a farre diuerſe qualitie that which they haue receaued, then it ſtood by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the family of Marſie in Italie, &amp; Pſillie in Lybia: which was ſo te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered, that they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt ſucke the poyſon of vipers, and without perill did vſually hunt them: and ſo by neceſſary conſequence to be gathered, that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue nouriſhment by them. What ſoeuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the ſtomach, either is altered into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie of nature: or elſe hauing an actuall power not hindered, altereth with repugnancie the nature which hath receaued it. If it altereth it wholly, then deſtroyeth it; if in part; then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth it on the one part nouriſhing and alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie vertue, and on the other, a medicinable power; ſo it ſhould ſeeme theſe Pſillie, euen by vertue of nature made nouriſhment of that,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6813:17"/>which to other is deadly poyſon. Whereupon it may be gathered, that nouriſhments in ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies haue not ſuch power, as I haue ſaid before; ſeeing they be made in certaine of poyſon. The ſame may be declared in duckes and hennes, which feede vpon toads, notwithſtanding their fleſh we feed of with health, and ſtrength, to our bodies; Quailes likewiſe feede of neeſing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeeds, and feldfares of hemlocke, the one much approching nigh vnto, and the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by the Athenian executions, for moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous poiſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which notwithſtanding, their fleſh is not refuſed at the tables of the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and daintieſt: hereby in apparance it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that it skilleth not much, what meat is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in reſpect of ſuſtaining this or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; ſeeing that poyſons may be made by vertue of concoction familiar nouriſhment: yea which is more auailable to vphold this matter, and ſtraunge to conſider of; it hath bene known and is recorded in credible hiſtorie, that ſome haue bene brought vp from their youth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue bene ſuſtained and fed with poyſon; which being ſo, the nouriſhments of the bodie not onely receaue preparation by naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, by which they become that in deede &amp; effect, which before they were in power &amp; poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: but ſeeme to be made out of whatſoeuer is receaued; where it findeth a nature of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength to frame it: and not (as it was wont to be ſayd) Mercurie is not made of euery tree, ſo nature maketh euerie thing of any thing: not by Anaxagoras art, for then ſhould breade

               <p>THESE ſhewes and ſemblances of truthes may ſeeme to ouerthrowe that which hath bene ſet downe as the ground and matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, &amp; lay it rather in the nature of the thing nouriſhed, to transforme and aſſimulate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it hath receaued, though it be of neuer ſo ſtraunge a qualitie: but as I haue ſet downe theſe obiections, to the end that trueth being compared with vntruth may the better appeare by reaſon of compariſon, ſo marke for your ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſatisfying in this point, howe yet nothing is hereby loſt, but ſufficiently it maintaineth it ſelfe: and by ſtrength of reaſon, the only pillar of humane truthes it is vpholden. It was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before how nouriſhments as of all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, ſo of melancholie, they affoord the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the which nature applying her proper temper as an inſtrument, and practizing that skill which ſhe hath learned of God, worketh out both humours and ſubſtance for preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nouriſhment of our bodies; nowe that the earth within ſmall diſtance affoordeth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment both to henbane &amp; lettis, to hemlocke and the mallow, to poiſon and wholſome herbs;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6813:18"/>that the ſame floure nouriſheth the ſpider, and yeldeth honie to the bee, that the <hi>paſtinacamari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> carieth the inſtrument of death in her tayle, and wholſome foode in her ſubſtance, and all what hath bene before obiected from Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides; the Oſtridges, Pſilli and Marſi, neeſing powder, hemlocke and toades, whereof whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome birds do aduenture for nouriſhment, and from that virgine fed and ſuſtained with poiſon ſent vnto Alexander to infect him with hir com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: all I ſay that may out of theſe particulars encounter the former truthes, being conſidered and wayed, adde this thereunto (taking away nothing) that to the diſpoſition of the matter, it is alſo neceſſarie, an outward skill and ſcience in the worker concurre, whereby that matter may receaue conuenient forme agreable to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers intention. For as it is impoſſible to make a rope of ſande, ſo likewiſe hempe maketh it not without the art of the craftes man, who ioyning his worke with conuenient ſtuffe findeth the end of his labour: and as ſome workemen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede other in skill &amp; diligence and of the ſame matter, the worke either excelleth or wanteth according thereunto; in like manner the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment being all one, as it falleth to a nature of good or bad temper, weake or ſtrong, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth nouriſhment, and excrement accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Touching the earth it containeth in it inuiſible ſeedes of all things in a maner, to which it ſtoreth vp and importeth alſo food meet and conuenient: theſe ſeeds lye not diſtinct in place but in nature, no more then the partes of bloud
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6813:19"/>which before I mentioned, ſo that although it were poſſible for hemlocke and the vine to grow in one bodie, and occupie one place, yet could not the proper nouriſhment to either be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſuch harmonie and agreement is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them in nature, and with ſuch earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire doth the one affect the other. This then is the cauſe why life and death dwell ſo nigh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet (as they are of the vehementeſt ſort of aduerſaries) without entercommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Euen ſo the bodie containeth partes linked notwithſtanding in one communitie, of diuerſe natures, which drawe out of the maſſe of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment that which is meete ech one for it ſelf: which though it in apparance, &amp; ſhew, ſemeth vniforme, yet containeth it diuerſity, as the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie parts require: which diuerſity being diſtinct in nature, &amp; confuſed as it appeareth in one by the cloke &amp; garment of an vniuerſall forme; by natures Mechanical operation (the very patern of all arts, both liberall and ſeruile) is diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; brought into an actuall ſubſtance conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his ſingle &amp; proper nature, which before had only a potentiall ſubſiſtence as members &amp; parts haue in the whole. Which producing I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not a diſcouerie only, as by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vaile, to ſhew that which lay behind it, but a generation and coupling of matter with the forme; which forme it bringeth not with it, but receaueth it as it were an impreſſion from the part. So then, as euerie thing is not made of any thing in art; neither is foode miniſtred for all things in euerie thing in nature: but requireth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6813:19"/>apt preparation of matter, by naturall vertue to be appropriate to euerie part. Nowe if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: this anſwer, as it may ſuffice againſt that which is obiected out of the earth, yet leaueth it doubtin the <hi>paſtinaca;</hi> Cantharides and Pſilli: by reaſon the matter of theſe things through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures working groweth more particular, &amp; is not ſtored with ſuch varietie (as I may ſo call them) of potentiall natures; whereby it might ſeeme the verie indiuiduall ſubſtance indifferently to ſubiect it ſelfe either for nouriſhment or poiſon: let the conſideration of the earth carrie vs yet farther to the diſſoluing of this knot alſo. True it is, that the particular nouriſhment containeth not ſo manie ſutes, as the earth the nouriſher of all things doth: yet it anſwereth in proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the part which it hath to ſuſtaine. So that the maſſe of bloud being the vniuerſall ſoile, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth not for the relief &amp; entertainment of al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie, choiſe of ſubſtance according to their variety. Hereof is the bone nouriſhed, as hard as mettall: and the braine as tender as a poſſet curd: the kidneyes groſſe and thicke: and the lights looſe and ſubtile: the eye as cleere as criſtall: and the ſplene as blacke and darke as inke. Now let vs apply this more particularly to Paſtinaca, Cantharis, and the reſt of that ſort, The Paſtinaca, ſubſtance, and fiſh, is nouriſhed with that which in it ſelfe is wholeſome, the fiſh being of the ſame ſubſtance or diſpoſition; but ſo, that, that nouriſhment hath in it an execre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſubſtance, which being conſidered alone though it be not yet poyſon, hath in it a power,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6813:20"/>meeting with a former, to become of like hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full qualitie: which we ſee in execrements being permitted to putrifie and to degenerate of them ſelues, howe by corruption they become moſt daungerous; much more finding an actiue and liuely nature furniſhed with power as it were to animate and waken that which before lay dead in ſuch matter: ſo Paſtinaca hath a weapon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by nature ſoked with moſt deadly venome ſeparated yet from the fiſh, and ſticking on the one ſide of the middeſt of the taile, which is maintained with ſuch a kinde of excrement, as being reiected in all the parts, findeth there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and entertainment: not either that the fiſh feede of that poiſon (for nothing feedeth of excrement, appropriate to one part, or that wherewith that part, while it is excrement is nouriſhed) as venimous, for then ſhould ſuch as feede of that fiſh be in perill, but being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete to nouriſh or to haue place in the fiſh, is of temper, (by the altering of that part) apt to be conuerted into ſo venemous a nature, which is planted in the fiſhes tayle, not much vnlike to the growing of Miſleto in a crab tree, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do apparantly differ, ſeing the ſame Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to groweth alſo in the oke &amp; on the hauthorne: neither can anie with reaſon affirme, the Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is nouriſhed with that which belongeth to the crab: for then would it not proſper in the oke deſtitute of his proper iuyce, but both the oke, the crab tree and the hauthorne, certaine of them, and in certaine places, hauing a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie meete for that vſe, the ſeed of that miſle
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6813:20"/>being there and embracing that humour, riſeth vp into ſuch a diuerſe plant as we ſee; which yet according to the diuerſitie of place, varieth in vertue, for that only of the oke we vſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt auaileable againſt the falling ſickneſſe &amp; eſteeme the other of ſmall value. Nowe if it be demaunded, why then groweth not the miſle on the earth, which hath more plenty of ſuch iuice, and greater choyce? it may be thus aunſwered: although the earth affoordeth entertainement for all things, yet it doth it diuerſly, to ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, to other ſome by meanes, as the earth miniſtreth iuyce to the graſſe and herbe of the common field, it nouriſheth mutton, &amp; we feed thereof; who if we ſhould attempt to be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the herbe, it would yeeld vs but thinne fare. This iuyce of the earth is altered into an other nature in the herbe, that herbe into fleſh, and fleſh of that kinde chaunged into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our bodies, which firſt as it ſprung vp from the earth, ſo by it is it releeued. So the miſle draweth from the earth, by meanes of the tree wherewith it proſpereth, indued now with other forme, &amp; made more familiar vnto it, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the tree. And this I take to be the cauſe why certaine things will not growe on the earth, but in other natures: and why graffes yeld more pleaſant fruit then carnels, by reaſon the ſtocke giueth the crude and rawe nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the earth a farther ripening, and euen as it were chewing it vnto the ſion graffed: ſo to conclude this aunſwer; the Paſtinacas venome is miniſtred by an excrement, which carieth an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6813:21"/>aptnes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into poiſon: and ſuch poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as that part is able: therof to engender, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being ſuch before in the Paſtinaces nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, nor in the ſubſtance of the fiſh, nor as excrement; but after it is conuerted thereinto by that barbed weapon; which the fiſh reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth within her tayle. Whereby it is euident, that not only of poyſon, but of any humor beſide, the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the matter (whereof ſome be groſſer, and ſome paſſe more alterations) it is neceſſary alſo there ſhoulde concurre in the place nouriſhed, an altering vertue; and as ſuch aſſimilation is neceſſary, in like manner an apt matter may not be to ſecke, ſit for ſuch generation. Wherefore Melancholie is not made of euerie part of good nouriſhment, but of ſuch parte, as hath a token of fellowſhip with the ſame Melancholie: and more or leſſe as the bodie is more or leſſe apte, together with aptnes of the matter to make that conuerſion. Touching the Oſtridge which may ſeeme to turne yron into blood and ſo into fleſh: we are rather thus to eſteeme, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Oſtridges nature doth intend nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment by the yron; yet doth it no more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, then ſtones doth chickins, &amp; hennes which are diſſolued in their mawes. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſay you) &amp; why doth it diſſolue yron? by a contrary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which reſpecteth all thinges alike, that are receiued: whereby the ſtomach becommeth the moſt Catholicke parte in all the bodie, carying a more indifferent affection to whatſoeuer is receiued then anie part beſide, which in the firſt concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regardeth not ſo much it ſelf as other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6813:21"/>partes, for whoſe ſake it is ordayned, as it were, the Cooke not reſpecting this or that ſorte of nouriſhment or foode, but applying it ſelfe alike generally to all that hath not a reſiſtance in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a counterpower of poyſon, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes altereth and is not altered. Elſe could it not ſo eaſily embrace both hote and cold, ſower and ſweete, fat and leane, moyſt and drie, of all bougetts (as a certaine Poet ſayth) in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſtraungeſt; by this vertue the Oſtridges hauing a verie thick and fleſhie mawe, whereby it is furniſhed with ſtore of a naturall heate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth by a kinde of putrefaction, the yron; which if it yeeld anie nouriſhment, the ſtomach findeth benefite thereof in the blood, wherwith it is nouriſhed, if none, it paſſeth all into excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſo is voyded as vnprofitable, except it may be thought more likely in reaſon, that the Oſtridges enioyeth ſome parte of nouriſhment, thereby paſſing it into blood, or at the leaſt that the ſtomach receiueth a kinde of comfort and contentment, which commonly it is taken to do by the nouriſhment it containeth as the Cooks appetite may be ſatisfied for a time by ſmelling of the roſt, which if it faire ſo with the ſtomach there is then reaſon ſufficient of ſuch digeſtion which the fowle worketh not by the exceſſe of heat, but by a certaine temper at for the work, for no heate of fire in longe time is able to doe that which the Oſtridge mawe doth ſpeedelie by a certaine corruption of that which it dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. Carying as it were a kinde of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in the mawe, rather then anie heate of <hi>Etna,</hi> if we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6813:22"/>take it that the fowle hath ſome parte in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whoſe turne the common officer, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſerueth, agreeing to the nature of ſome ſubſtance contained in the yron, &amp; that conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the blood, and from thence drawen to that part, wherof it is affected: or it hath an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie vertue common to diuerſe partes. Be it ſo, yet therefore no conſequence of reaſon can inferre, that nature reſpecteth not anie aptnes of matter: for in a manner al things of the earth hath ſome thinge Alimentarie and paſturable for all liuing creatures, which may euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring of nature. The earth which we plow and till and labour with hard and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hand is altogether mynerall, which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralleſt nouriſhment of all: now if one nature among ſo manie millions be found in yron to ſucke forth that vertue, no maruell ſeing all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures which require releefe of foode, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine degrees and former apparations, pertake of the ſame: then ſeing the Mineralls feede the Vegetalls, and the Vegetalls the Animalls; let the experience of the Oſtridge ſatisfie vs in this which reaſon miſliketh not, that euen a nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue iuice for ſome ſorte of Animall may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in yron, and yet ſo, that (notwithſtanding) not all things are of like aptnes for ſuch vſe, neither in generall as blood, nor in particular, as the more ſpeciall food belonging to ech parte deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the blood. And thus my friend <hi>M.</hi> to paſſe the tedious time with you, you haue my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to this obiection. As for the ſtraunge na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that kinde of people or famelie called
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6813:22"/>
                  <hi>Marſi</hi> and <hi>Pſilli,</hi> we may thus reaſonably conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that either they had a nature of ſtronger temper, then the ordinary ſorte, by which it was able to maiſter that poyſon and all other; or elſe by the cuſtome of vſuall feeding on the fleſh of aſpes and vipers, which they did vſe, they grewe into ſuch familiarity with the poyſon, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes themſelues, which nature had with ſuch poiſon ſo armed, and this rather then that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous refuge of propriety of ſubſtance, which is aſmuch to ſay, as we knowe not. This cuſtome was alſo the only cauſe why the yong maid nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with poyſon faired with it as with other victuall: for of purpoſe ſhe was nouriſhed from her infancie therwith, that ſhe might by freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kinges companie deſtroy him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which poyſon being but an accidentary thing, by cuſtome is vanquiſhed of a naturall &amp; eſſentiall vertue. That poyſon is but accidentall and not eſſentiall, it appeareth by that in diuers kindes, it is not in all of the ſame ſorte, nor alike in all partes of ſuch natures, as we count vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as the wings of Cantharides and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo contend in nature, that the one helpeth where the other harmeth: the weapon of Paſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naca and the fiſh, the Scorpion and his ſtinge, the vipers bitte and vipers fleſh, the baſe and foundation of Triacle, the ſhrewmouſe and her ſelfe diſſected and applied to the wound: which all argue the poyſon not to be equallie mixed, and therefore not eſſentiall: againe in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Scorpions are not hurtefull, in ſome ſpiders, in other ſome aſpides, the which if their nature
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6813:23"/>did conſiſt of poyſon, then could they not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, neither receiue alteration by ſoile, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this in animalls onelie, but alſo in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, as in Perſea, in Hemlockes, in Napellus in the Vgh tree which in other ſome places carie with them certaine and aſſured perill, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome are vtterly harmeles. This cuſtome being begunne in infancie, made a greater fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie betwixt the damſells nature, &amp; the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which as in ciuill manners it is more flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in youth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in proceſſe of yeares, ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of nature fareth in like ſort, which moſt hartely embraceth that wherewith it is firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, but you wil ſay; how could it haue firſt acceſſe and be entertayned of nature, to whome it is ſo repugnant. Thus we are to iudge in the caſe, that they which firſt practiſed this ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge kinde of nouriſhing, by litle and litle aſſayed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and now and then gaue harte therunto by counterpoyſon preſeruatiues, and ſo at the laſt, being encouraged, and farther ſtrengthened, it was able to ouercome that parte of the poyſon; which of it ſelfe was deadly and turne the other into familiar nouriſhment, which by reaſon of acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce through cuſtome, her nature brake which if it had ben all poyſon, then as it had bin whollie &amp; vnfit matter of nouriſhment, ſo could ſhee not without daunger haue borne it one howre: whereby it is manifeſt, that with natures arte an apt matter of producing of nouriſhment muſt needes meete for her maintenance. That which Cantharides offereth of doubt, may be ſufficiently reſolued by that which hath bin ſaid
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6813:23"/>of Paſtinaca. The quailes feeding of He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lock, &amp; the other of neeſing powder, moue more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult queſtions, ſeing they make the poiſon hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome nouriſhment to themſelues &amp; yeeld their bodies, daintie diſhes to our tables, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their poyſoned foode: Whereby it ſhould ſeeme, that poyſon it ſelf, where a nature fitteth, therewith may be matter of holeſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the ſatisfying of which obiection, we are to conſider euerie parte of that we take for nouriſhment, is not alimentall but parte excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the greateſt parte, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by ſo manie alterations, and purginges, which the foode ſuffereth, before it be receiued of the partes of the bodie for proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo therfore; theſe birdes are not ſuſtained with that which is poyſonfull in their foode, but alter it firſt, and then paſſe it into ſuperfluous excrement; their ſubſtance being vtterly voide of the ſame, and ſo becometh vnto vs holeſome: verie well: but how is their nature able to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh that which is poyſon: ſeing it is not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs without preſent daunger? Diuerſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof may be alleadged, firſt, it is not poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vnto them, as we ſee ſome kindes of Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites to kill dogges, ſome Leopardes, and ſome wolues, and not offenſiue to our creatures: then, that it may be by exceſſiue heate of the mawes of ſuch birdes, then cold poyſon of Hemlock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth ſufficient alteration to keepe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of poyſon. Whereto may alſo be added, the reaſon of Galen, that becauſe the vaines &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of thoſe birdes are ſtraighte, the poyſon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6813:24"/>before it aſſaileth the hart in the way receiueth ſufficient alteration; eſpecially Hemlock being ſo cold poyſon, and therefore ſlowe of paſſage in reſpect of it ſelfe, and ſhutting vp, and ſtraighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of poores, by which it paſſeth: ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this probleme, we ſee the ſentence ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth yet ſure, that nouriſhments are the matter of all humors, and by conſequence of Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and although natures wonderfull arte ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in making (as it may ſeeme in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) one contrary to another, yet doth it not ſo in deede, but alwayes deſireth conuenient matter to practiſe her naturall acte vpon: and thus much to the obiections, now to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelues.</p>

               <p>THvs much hath bene ſaid to the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, now let vs declare at large to your fuller ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, what I iudge moſt agreable to the truth in the queſtions: and firſt, whether ſome bodies do not turne good nouriſhment, and of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſort into greater quantitie of melancholie, then other ſome? which queſtion if we conſider parted, it may more clearly be decided, that is, firſt whether the ſame nouriſhment be not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into more or leſſe plentie of melancholie in other bodies? then, whether by anie qualitie of temper, good and pure nouriſhment may yeeld an humour melancholicke? To theſe queſtions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6813:24"/>firſt I aunſwer affirmatiuely, yet not impairing of the former truth ſet downe. For all kinde of nouriſhment as it in part altereth the bodies, ſo is it againe of them more altered then it alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, whereby melancholicke perſons of the ſelf ſame nouriſhment frame vnto them ſelues that which to them ſelues is agreeable: elſe could there be no nouriſhment without this altering vertue. Why then (ſay you) it riſeth not of the nouriſhment, which was not melancholicke, but of the nature nouriſhed. Not ſo, for no nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo pure, that altogether it is voyd of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke matter, for then could it not be nouriſhment: but notwithſtanding it hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plentie of good nouriſhment then of groſſe and melancholicke, the ſimilitude of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the one, and embraceth the other: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon riſeth this difference in nouriſhment, the vitall being alone. The ſecond part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queſtion, receaueth the ſame anſwer with the firſt, becauſe no nouriſhment is ſo pure but it partaketh little or much, with ſome part of melancholie. For I do not take it, that the part maketh the nouriſhment melancholicke, which carieth no diſpoſition thereunto: but luſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that in the maſſe of victualles, wherewith it hath greater familiaritie, which to a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke bodie is of an impurer diſpoſition, refuſing that would ſerue more fitly for a better tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red complexion; euen as we ſee oft by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that the good complexion may be repleniſhed with melancholicke bloud: which appeareth by opening a vaine, and yet the parties bodie nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6813:25"/>(as the beautie of colour doth declare) with that which is pure, which melancholicke bloud roſe of euill choice of diet, rather then through fault of complexion: nowe that part of nouriſhment, that is pure cannot be altered in ſubſtance into another, whereto it carrieth no proportion: by mixture it may be defiled, and become impure, but neither can it be altered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, wherewith it hath no community, more then groſſe, melancholicke, and earthy nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment can by any art of nature become aëry, moderate and pure: I meane the ſelf ſame part of nouriſhment: for ſo might all things in deede riſe of euerie thing, which would turne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent varietie of naturall things into vnitie. As for Anaxagoras imagination of breeding things by ſeparation onely, this kind of diuerſe matter, which we require in nouriſhment ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth it, neither are we to thinke generation of nouriſhment to be no other but as art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon her ſubiect, for there, is there no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture produced, diſtinct in ſubſtance and eſſence, but by an accidentall qualitie only produced by art. And thus leſt I be ouer tedious in this point, you haue my anſwer to the queſtions and obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions before made concerning the nature of nouriſhing and preparation of humors, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto that hath bene ſayd, reſpecteth only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, as it is an humour in the bodie apt for nouriſhment of certaine partes, more diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to that, then to any other portion of the bloud beſides, nowe touching the cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and exceſſe of this humour.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the cauſes of the increaſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of melancholicke humour.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT was declared that the quantitie of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie ſhould be leaſt in the iuſt te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per of bloud of all the other parts, ſauing choler, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall proportion and rate when it exceedeth, then is the bodie turned into a diſpoſition me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke by humour: although the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion for a time hold entire, which long can not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, more then the nature of that damſel which was nouriſhed with poyſon, kept her ingenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted complexion: but nature acquainting it ſelfe by moments and degrees with ſuch kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and hauing no choice of better, is faine at length to embrace that, which otherwiſe more gladly it would reiect. The cauſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this humour are diuerſe, and all (except it be receaued from the parent) ſpring from fault of diet: and although chieflie meates and drinkes do yeeld matter to this humour, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the complexion inclining to ſuch temper, this matter is increaſed by perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind, by temper of aire, and kind of habitation, and that humour which otherwiſe would yeeld a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritiue iuyce, of the beſt ſort, by this occaſion is turned into theſe dregges of melancholie. Here firſt I will declare vnto you, ſuch nouriſhments as are apt to engender thoſe humours, that in this preſent ſtate you nowe ſtand in, oppreſſed therewith, knowing which they are that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter matter to this groſſe iuyce, you for your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6813:26"/>more ſpeedie recouerie auoide them, and with choice of better, alter that which is amiſſe into a more cheerfull qualitie. Nowe all nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that offende vs, either do it by their owne nature, or by ſome accidentarie cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling vnto them, and likewiſe whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth vnto vs melancholicke. But that you may more eaſilie vnderſtand from whence all ſorts of nouriſhments are taken, I will ſet downe vnto you in a ſhort viewe, the kinds of them all, and in euerie kind note vnto you, that which of the owne nature is melancholicke. You knowe all nouriſhmentes are either meate or drinke: meates are taken either from vegetables or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls: the vegetables either miniſter vnto vs nouriſhment them ſelues, or their fruit onely, &amp; they are either of trees or herbs: of trees, the tender buds are eaten, which becauſe we do li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vſe to feed of, I paſſe ouer farther mention. Of herbes we either feede of the root, or ſuch partes as riſe therefrom, and thoſe roots are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther round or long, of neither ſort do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber anie greatly to be eſchewed as melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, except rape rootes &amp; nauewes. Such parts as riſe from the root, are vſed while they be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and young, or elſe ſprung vp at the full, of theſe kinds, cole worts, beete, and cabages only ingender a melancholicke iuyce. The fruites of vegetables are either of trees or herbes: of fruits of trees, quinces rawe, medlers, ſeruices, dates, oliues, cheſnuts and acornes are all melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: fruites of herbes, are either graine or of other ſort, and thoſe are either corne or pulſe:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6813:26"/>of corne, ſodden wheate is of a groſſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke nouriſhment, and bread eſpeciallie of the fine flower vnleauened: of this ſort, are bag puddings, or pan puddings made with flour, fritters, pancakes, ſuch as we call Banberie cakes, and thoſe great ones confected with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, egges &amp;c. vſed at weddings, and howſoeuer it be prepared, rie and bread made thereof, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it plentie of melancholie. The pulſes are wholy to be eſchewed, of ſuch as are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to melancholie: except white peaſe: fruites of herbes of other ſort then graine are pureſt from melancholicke exceſſe. And thus of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables you vnderſtand, which you haue in this melancholicke reſpect to be auoyded. The food which we take from the animals, is either from them ſelues, and from certaine of their whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome excrements. Such as yeeld them ſelues are either of the earth, or of the water: thoſe of the earth haue great diuerſitie of nouriſhment in their ſeuerall parts, which are either ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and thoſe of white colour: or ſanguine, of colour redde and bloudie. The ſpermaticall partes may well be diſcharged of melancholicke iuyce, as rather enclining to fleume. Of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine partes, ſome are the brawnie parts, which compaſſe the bones, and are ordayned for vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie motion, called muſcles: or elſe are of the inward partes, and are of them ſelues deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of motion. The muſcles which are ſubiect to moſt motion, as of the leggs, yeeld more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, then partes which haue more reſt. Of the inwardes, the milt is altogether melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6813:27"/>&amp; ſo the kidneyes, the liuer, the heart, and with them, all the carnels. Bloud is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke, and whatſoeuer diſh thereof is made. Nowe all nouriſhments taken from the earth, are either beaſtes, or foule. Of beaſts; theſe are of melancholike perſons to be eſchewed: porke, except it be yong, and a litle corned with ſalt, beefe, ramme mutton, goate, bores fleſh, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſon: neither is mutton of anie ſort greatly commended of Galen. Of foule, ſome be water foule, and ſome land. The water foule are not of melancholicke perſons to be taſted, except the gooſewings. The land foule which are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke are theſe: feldfares, thruſhes, ſparowes, martins, turtles, ringdoues, quailes, plouers, peacockes &amp;c. and theſe haue you to eſchew of nouriſhments of the earth. Thoſe of the water are fiſh: &amp; either of the ſalt water and ſea; or of the freſh water. Such as are of the ſea, are either of the monſters of the ſea; or ſuch as more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly are to be called fiſh. The mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters are ceals purpoſes, &amp; ſuch like: which all breed vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome &amp; melancholicke nouriſhment. The fiſh of the ſea are either ſhell fiſh, or deſtitute of ſuch defence. Of ſhell fiſh, ſome are of harder ſhels, as oyſters, periwincks, muſcles, cockles, &amp; ſuch like: of which ranke, the oyſter carieth with it leaſt ſuſpition of melancholy. The ſofter ſhell or cruſtie are cray fiſh, the crab, the lobſter, the pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; ſuch of the riuers like to theſe &amp;c. which all neede not to be excepted vnto you in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your diet. Such ſea fiſh as carie no armor of ſhels, are ether thoſe, that haunt the rocks: or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6813:27"/>other parts of the ſea. The rocke fiſhes are moſt apt of all maner ſea fiſh, for melancholicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: as the gilthead, the whiting, the ſea perch &amp;c. Such as haunt other places, are either kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the depth; or aprochers nigh the ſand &amp; ſhore. Of ſuch as keepe the depth, either they haue the pooles: or other places of the depth. Of the poole fiſhes, I remember not any greatly to be auoyded in choyce of your diet. Of ſuch as frequent other places of the depth, theſe are melancholicke: the dragon of the ſea, in forme like an eyle: the cuckoe, ling, anie ſalt fiſh, thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and skate. Of ſuch as approch the ſhore, I knowe none greatly to be auoyded. Freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fiſh, and of the riuer: the lampray, and the tench, haue moſt plentie of melancholie. And theſe are nouriſhments taken from the parts of the animals: now their works are either excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; ſuperfluities of their humors, or other kinds of workes. Of the firſt ſort, are milke from the beaſt, and egges from the foule: which the ſpawne of fiſh in a maner reſembleth: milke, and what ſoeuer is made thereof, is to be eſchewed of melaneholie perſons: as cheeſe, curdes, &amp;c. the ſpaunes, as roes of hearinges, are to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chued of you, as nouriſhment of melancholie: elſe I take none of that ſort greatly to be feared in that reſpect. Of other works of animals then excrements, we feed only of honie, which hath no melancholy diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al. Of drinks, eſchue red wine, and what ſoeuer liquor, beare, ale, or cider, is not cleere, &amp; well fined: as alſo if it be tart, and ſower. Hitherto haue you hearde of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6813:28"/>nouriſhmentes, which of their owne nature are to be eſchued; nowe of thoſe that by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not of them ſelues are melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, as if they be too olde, and verie leane: or be long kept: or ouer much ſalted: whereby they become the drier and harder, you are to refuſe them. Likewiſe if in the dreſſing of the nouriſhment, it be ouermuch baked, or roſted, it is to be eſchued. To theſe belong ſalt fiſhe, beefe, and bacon, and redde hearringes, hard cheeſe, and old. Of drinkes, newe wine, beare or ale: and on the contrarie part, ouer ſtale, and ſower, are to be eſchued: and of ſauces, thoſe that be ſharpe, as veriuyce, aliger, or beareger, vineger, are chieflie to be auoided of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke perſons. Thus do you vnderſtand howe to vſe your choice in meates, and drinks: and what to ſhunne, as breeders of this thicke, blacke, and melancholicke humour. Beſides theſe, the aire thicke and groſſe is ſit to entertaine this humor: ſo that fumie, marriſh, miſlie, and lowe habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are hurtfull to perſons diſpoſed to melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie: likewiſe if it be dimme &amp; dark. Wherfore the houſes, &amp; habitations of that ſort, are moſt vnmeete for ſuch perſons. Theſe hitherto are all ſuch outward things melancholick: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer elſe breedeth mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholie, is a diſorderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of our owne parts, in ſuch actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the gouernement of our health. This behauiour, is either in actions of motion: or in order and manner of reſt. Our motion, is either of mind, or bodie. Of actions of the minde, ouer vehement ſtudies, and ſadde paſſions, do alter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6813:28"/>good nouriſhmentes into a melancholicke qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; by waſting the pure Spirites, and the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt parte of the blood: and thereby leauing the reſt groſſe and thicke. In like ſorte do exerciſes either wholly intermitted; or turned into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue labour, and wearying of the bodie: the one cauſing the blood to be thicke through ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and the other, by ſpending the bodie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, &amp; drying it exceſſiuely. Such alſo as giue themſelues to inordinate ſleepe, therby further the encreaſe of melancholicke humours. And theſe are all the cauſes, whereby the matter of that humour is ſupplyed; and the blood being of it ſelfe good, is altered into that iuice, whereof you complaine of abundance. Now if to theſe, you adde a nature of it ſelfe diſpoſed thereto, &amp; a ſplene not able, either for feeblenes, or obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to purge the blood of ſuperfluitie of that iuyce, then haue you all that may be ſaid of the cauſes of this humour, keeping within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of nouriſhment.</p>

               <p>THE melancholicke excrement is bredde of melancholie iuyce, drawen of the milte out of the liuer, by a braunch of the porte vayne, wherewith being nouriſhed, it reiecteth the reſt as meere excrementall; and voydeth parte, into the mouth of the ſtomach, to prouoke appetite, and hunger; and paſſeth the other parte in ſome perſones, by hemerode vaynes into the ſiege: It
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6813:29"/>aboundeth there when it is hindered of ſuch paſſage as nature requireth; or elſe by feeblenes of the parte, it is not able, either to ſuck the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie from the blood, or diſcharge it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe paſſages, which nature hath therto or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. This member, of the whole bodie is the groſſeſt, and euill fauouredſt to be held, blacke of colour, and euill ſauorie of taſte: and giueth a manifeſt experience of natures deſire, alwayes to couet that, whereto it is moſt like; and ſo fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſplene better with thoſe muddy dreggs, then it would with purer and finer blood; which if it ſhould be offered to other parts, they would abſtaine: except great want forced them to take anie parte thereof. Theſe are the cauſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall melancholie, both iuyce, and excrement: It remaineth next, to ſhewe, what that humour is, which riſeth of this, or anie elſe, corrupted, called alſo by the name of melancholie.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6813:29"/>ſalt fleame: which take ſuch heate, partely by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the bodie, and partly by putrefaction that thereby a humor riſeth, breeding moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible accidentes to the minde, and painefull to the bodie: which the melancholicke and groſſe bloud, doth more forcibly procure: in that that anie heate, the groſſer the ſubſtance is, wherein it is receaued, the more fiercely it conſumeth: whereupon the ſeacole giueth more vehement heate, then charcole: and the cole then the flame: and a cauterie of hote yron, then a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firebrand Otherwiſe choler being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the hoteſt temper, carieth with it, more qualitie of heat then the other: but by reaſon the ſubſtance of the humor is more ſubtle and rare, the leſſe it appeareth: &amp;, as the heat of a flame in compariſon of the other, more ſpeedily paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.

               <p>BEFORE I declare vnto you how this humor afflicteth the minde: firſt it ſhall be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for you to vnderſtand, what the familiaritie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6813:30"/>is betwixt mind and bodie: howe it affecteth it, and how it is affected of it againe. You knowe, God firſt created all things ſubiect to the courſe of times, and corruption of the earth, after that hee had diſtinguiſhed the confuſed maſſe of things, into the heauens, &amp; the foure elements. This earth he had endued with a fecunditie of infinite ſeeds of all things: which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as a mother, to bring forth, and as it is moſt agreable to their nature, to entertaine with nouriſhment, that which it had borne, &amp; brought forth: whereby when he had all the furniture of this inferiour world, of theſe creatures, ſome he fixed there ſtill, and maintaineth the ſeedes, till the end of all things, and that determinate time, which he hath ordained, for the emptying of thoſe ſeedes of creatures, which he firſt indued the earth withall. Other ſome, that is to ſay, the animals, he drewe wholly from the earth at the beginning, and planted ſeede in them onely, and food from other creatures: as beaſts, and man in reſpect of his body: the difference only this: that likely it is, mans body was made of purer mould, as a moſt pretious tabernacle and temple, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the image of God ſhould afterward be inſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and being formed as it were by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, receaued a greater dignitie of beauty, and proportion, and ſtature erect: therby to be put in mind whither to direct the religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his Creator. This tabernacle thus wrought, as the groſſe part yeelded a maſſe for the proportion to be framed of: ſo had it by the bleſſing of God, before inſpired, a ſpirituall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6813:30"/>thing of greater excellencie, then the redde earth, which offered it ſelf to the eye onely. This is that which Philoſophers call the ſpirit: which ſpirit, ſo prepareth that worke to the receauing of the ſoule, that with more agrement, the ſoule, and bodie, haue growne into acquaintance: and is ordained of God, as it were a true loue knot, to couple heauen &amp; earth together; yea a more diuine nature, then the heauens with a baſe clod of earth: which otherwiſe would neuer haue growen into ſocietie: and hath ſuch indifferent affection vnto both, that it is to both equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and communicateth the bodie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things with the mind, and ſpirituall, and intelligible things, after a ſort with the bodie: ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſometimes by vehemencie of eithers actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſeeme to be diſtracted, and the minde to neglect the bodie: and the bodie and bodilie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions common with other creatures, to refuſe as it were for a moment that communitie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, that in vehement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, men ſee not, that which is before their eyes: neither heare, though noyſe be at the ayre and ſound: nor feele, which at other time (ſuch bent of the minde being remitted) they ſhould perceaue the ſence of, with pleaſure or paine. This ſpirit is the chiefe inſtrument, and immediate, whereby the ſoule beſtoweth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of her facultie in her bodie, that paſſeth to and fro in a moment, nothing in ſwiftneſſe &amp; nimbleneſſe being comparable thereunto: which when it is depraued by anie occaſion, either ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the bodie: or by other meanes, then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6813:31"/>becometh it an inſtrument vnhanſome for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as require the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and ſo the minde ſeemeth to be blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: wherein it is blameleſſe: and fault of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine actions imputed thereunto: wherein the bodie and this ſpirite are rather to be charged, thinges corporall and earthly: the one, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the other in reſpect of that mixture, wherewith the Lord tempered the whole maſſe in the beginning. And that you may haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance in reaſon of this corporall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, conſider how it is nouriſhed: and with more euidence, it ſhal ſo appeare vnto you. It is maintained by nouriſhments, whether they be of the vegetable, or animall kind: which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, affoord not only their corporall ſubſtance; but a ſpirituall matter alſo: wherewith euerie nouriſhment, more or leſſe is indued: this ſpirit of theirs, is (as ſimilitude of nature, more nighly approcheth) altered more ſpeedely, or with lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger trauell of nature. Of all things of ordinarie vſe, the moſt ſpeedy alteration is of wine: which in a moment repaireth our ſpirits, and reuiueth vs againe, being ſpent with heauineſſe: or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe whatſoeuer, our naturall ſpirites being diminiſhed: which bread, and fleſh, doth in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time: being of ſlower paſſage, and their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites not ſo ſubtile, or at leaſt fettered as it were in a more groſſe bodie: and without this ſpirit, no creature could giue vs ſuſtentation. For it is a knot, to ioyne both our ſoules and bodies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo nothing of other nature can haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall coniunction with vs; except their ſpirites
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6813:31"/>with ours firſt growe into acquaintance: which is more ſpeedily done a great deale, then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the firme ſubſtance: which you may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently perceaue in that we are ready to faint, for want of foode; after a litle taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of refreſhing, before any concoction can be halfe reformed, the ſtrength returneth, and the ſpirit reuiueth, and ſufficient contentment ſeemeth to be giuen to nature: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not fully ſo ſatisfied, prepareth farther the aliment of firme ſubſtance, and ſpirits of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort, for the continuall ſupply of thoſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, for ſence &amp; motion, life &amp; nouriſhment. Nowe although theſe ſpirites riſe from earthly creatures; yet are they more excellent, then earth, or the earthie parts of thoſe natures, from which they are drawne; and riſe from that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine influence of life, and are not of them ſelues earthie: neither yet comparable in pureneſſe &amp; excellencie, vnto that breath of life, wherewith the Lord made Adam a liuing ſoule, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from any creature, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made, as the life of beaſts and trees; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from him ſelfe, repreſenting in ſome part the character of his image. So then theſe three we haue in our nature to conſider diſtinct, for the clearer vnderſtanding of that I am to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of: the bodie of earth: the ſpirit from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that ſpirit, which did as it were hatch that great egge of Chaos: &amp; the foule inſpired from God, a nature eternall and diuine, not fettered with the bodie, as certaine Philoſophers haue taken it: but handfaſted therwith, by that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6813:32"/>claſpe of the ſpirit: whereby, one, (till the predeſtinate time be expired, and the bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnmeet for ſo pure a ſpouſe) ioyeth at, and taketh liking of the other. Nowe as it is not poſſible to paſſe from one extreme to an other, but by a meane; and no meane is there in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, but ſpirit: by this only the bodie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the mind: and the bodie and ſpirits affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, partly by diſorder, and partly through out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occaſions, miniſter diſcontentment as it were to the mind: and in the ende breake that bande of fellowſhip, wherewith they were both linked together. This affecting of the minde, I vnderſtand not to be any empairing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof; or decay of any facultie therein; or ſhortning of immortality; or any ſuch infirmitie inflicted vpon the ſoule from the bodie (for it is farre exempt from all ſuch alteration): but ſuch a diſpoſition, and ſuch diſcontentment, as a falſe ſtringed lute, giueth to the muſician: or a rough and euill faſhioned pen, to the cunning writer: which only obſcureth, the ſhew of either art, and nothing diminiſheth of that facultie, which with better inſtruments, would fully content the eye with a faire hand; &amp; ſatisfie the eare with moſt pleaſant and delectable harmonie. Otherwiſe the ſoule receaueth no hurt from the bodie; it being ſpirituall, and voyde of all paſſion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thinges; and the other groſſe, earthie, and farre vnable to annoy a nature of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.</p>

               <p>IN this ſorte then are you to conceiue me, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe actions, which the bodie ſeemeth to offer violence to the ſoule; in that no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſubſtance, or nature, can riſe there from, nor anie blemiſh of naturall facultie, or decaye of ſuch qualities, as are eſſentiall vnto the ſoule: otherwiſe, might it in the end periſh, and deſtroy that immortall nature; which can not by anie meanes decaie, but by the ſame power which created it. But thus onely doe (as I may ſo call them) paſſions force the ſoule; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the euill diſpoſed inſtrument of the bodie, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue the moſt excellent and moſt perfect acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereto the ſoule is bent in the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of mans nature, and by corruption of the Spirites, which ſhould be the ſacred band of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cauſe ſuch miſlike, as the ſoule, without that mediation, diſdaineth the bodies longer fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and betaketh it ſelfe, to that contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereto it is by nature inclyned; and giueth ouer the groſſe, and mechanicall actions of the bodie, whereto, by order of creation, it was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the earthly tabernacle. But you wil ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, experience ſeemeth to declare a further paſſion of the ſoule from the bodie then I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for we ſee what iſſues, bodelie thinges, and the bodie it ſelfe driue our mindes vnto: as ſome kinde of muſicke, to heauines; other ſome to chearefulnes; other ſome to compaſſion; other ſome to rage; other to modeſtie; and other to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6813:33"/>wantonnes: likewiſe of viſible thinges, certayne ſturre vs to indignation and diſdayne; and other to contentednes, and good liking. In like manner certaine natures take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inward, moue vs to mirth: as wyne; and other to heauines; ſome to rage, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and frenſie; and other ſome to dulnes &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of ſpirite: as certaine poyſones in both kinds do manifeſt theſe paſſions vnto vs; beſides ſuch as riſe of our humours bredde in our owne bodies; which may be reaſons, to one not well aduiſed, ſo to miſtake theſe effectes of corporall thinges, as though the ſoule receiued farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, not onely in affection, but alſo in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, then I haue vnto you mentioned: for ſatisfying of you, in which doubtes, you are diligently to conſider, what I ſhall declare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeuerall actions of bodie, ſoule and ſpirite, and how, each one of theſe performeth their actions: which muſt be kept diſtinct, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding of that I ſhall hereafter in this diſcourſe lay open vnto you. And firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the actions of the ſoule: you remember how it was firſt made by inſpiration from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, a creature immortall, proceeding from the eternall; with whome there is no mortality. The end of this creation was, that being vnited to the bodely ſubſtance, raiſed and furniſhed with corporall faculties from the earth, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with other liuing creatures, there might riſe a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of middle nature betwixt Angels, &amp; beaſtes, to glorifie his name. This the ſoule doth, by two kindes of actions: the one kinde, is ſuch as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth, ſeperated from the bodie; which are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6813:33"/>contemplations of God, in ſuch meaſure as he is by naturall inſtinct opened vnto it, with reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t recogniſaunce of ſuch bleſſinges, as by creation it is endued with. Next vnto God, whatſoeuer within compaſſe of her conceite is immortall, without tediouſnes, or trauell, and with ſpiritual ioye inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable. Theſe actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhe is buſied with in this life, ſo long as ſhe inhabiteth her earthly tabernacle; neither in ſuch perfection, nor yet ſo freely, as ſhe doth ſeperated, and the knot loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt her and the body, being withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by actions exerciſed with corporall inſtrument, of baſet ſort. Theſe are the other kinde which the ſoule, by the creators law is ſubiect vnto, for the continuance of the creature, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the whole nature, with dueties thereto belonging; animall, vitall, naturall; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mixed, requireth ioyntly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll three; as this corporall praiſing of God for his goodnes, and praying vnto him for neceſſities, releeuing our brothers want, and defending him from wrong; with euerie ones ſeuerall vocation, wherein his peculiar charge lyeth; whether it be in peace, or in warre; at home, or abroade, with our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or with ſtraungers; in our owne famelies, or with our neighbours; whether it be ſuperiority of commaudement, or duety of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: which differ in degree, as they be nigher, or farther of the actions peculiar to the ſoule; or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate more, or leſſe with them. If you ſay vnto me; how commeth it to paſſe, that the ſoule being of ſo ſingle, and diuine a nature, as the creation manifeſtly ſheweth, intermedleth with ſo groſſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6813:34"/>actions, as are common, not onely with bruite beaſtes; as ſenſe, motion and appetite; but euen alſo with natures of farre inferiour condition, as plantes, and mineralls: whereby it ſeemeth, that, either the ſoule is not of ſuch excellency, as in truth it is; or elſe that our nature conſiſteth of three ſoules, to which ſeuerall faculties, and actions are alotted. By deeper conſideration of the nature of the ſoule, this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily aunſwered. The ſoule, as the ſubſtance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is moſt pure, and perfect, and far of remoued from corruption; ſo it is endued with faculties of like qualitie, pure, immortall and anſwerable to ſo diuine a ſubiect; &amp; carrieth with it, an inſtinct ſcience, gotten, neither by precept, nor practiſe; but naturally therewith furniſhed; whereby it is able, with one vniuerſall, and ſimple facultie, to performe ſo many varieties of actions, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, by which it performeth them, carrieth an apt inclination thereto: as the brayne being an inſtrument of conceite, it therewith concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: the eye to ſee, it ſeeth: the eare to heare, it heareth: and ſo the inſtrument of ſmelling, and taſte, wanting nothing of their naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſoule ſmelleth with, &amp; diſcerneth taſts: which otherwiſe diſpoſed, it can not ſhewe that ingenerate inſtinct, by outward ſenſes, the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yet notwithſtanding remayning entyre and vntouched: I ſay the facultie, and not faculties. For if we plant ſo many faculties in the ſoule, as there be outward, and inward actions perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by vs, it certainely could not be ſimple, but needes muſt receiue varietie of compoſition; to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6813:34"/>aunſwer ſo many faculties, as we ſee inſenſible creatures; which as they worke diuerſly, ſo haue they diuerſe varieties of ſubſtance, of which ſort among many other is Aloe, Rhubarb, and diuers ſimples, that with one parte of their ſubſtance, looſe, and open; and with the other ſtoppe and ſtaie; the ſame alſo is ſenſible in colewortes and Cabages; and in the ſubſtance of ſhell fiſbes: whoſe decoction looſeth the bodie, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſoliblenes; their ſubſtance being of a quite contrary operation: which riſeth of a diuerſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered ſubſtance in one nature, compounded of ſuch varietie, whereof as the ſoule together vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, is voide, ſo can it not poſſeſſe any variety of facultie. This if it ſeeme ſtraunge vnto you, conſidering the diuerſe ſorts of actions, and the vnlikelines of performance of ſo many, and ſo diuerſe; I will as I may in a matter, ſo difficult, &amp; aboue the reach of any ſimilitude of viſible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature (except it ſelfe) only by compariſon, make the aſſertion more plaine. Compare the skill of painting, with this ſimple and vniforme faculty of the ſoule: the faculty is ſimple and one, and yet cold Apelles therewith vſe both the groſſe, &amp; the ſmall penſill; he could draw a line euident to the eye a farre of, and ſo ſubtle, that ſcarſe might it be diſcerned nigh at hand; he could applie himſelfe by his vniforme faculty, to all the parts of Venus beauty: otherwiſe muſt it of neceſſitie follow, that ſo many inſtrumentes of painting as he vſed, ſo many kinds of lines as he could draw, and ſo many partes as he could counterfet; the eye, the noſe, the mouth, &amp;c, ſo many ſundry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6813:35"/>of painting had he; which to a man not deſtitute of the facultie of reaſon, muſt needes ſeeme moſt abſurd. The ſame appeareth in the art of muſick, which being attayned vnto, but one facultie, yet is it the ſame: in all the kindes of moodes &amp; variety of tune, and time: although the practiſe be diuerſe. Euen ſo, the ſoule hath a faculty one, ſingle, and eſſentiall, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo many and ſundry partes are performed, in the organicall bodies, as we dayly put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: neither is it hereof to be gathered, that the ſoule affordeth no mo actions, then there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: for both her proper actions, require none, and the other common with the bodye, by diuerſe vſing and applying of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, are manifold and ſundry, and the more ſundry, the more generall the inſtrument is, and pliable, to diuerſe vſes: euen ſo, as the ſoule, in organicall actions, vſeth one and the ſelfe ſame inſtrument to chaungeable offices; likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from the body, although the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be one, it alſo exerciſeth of her ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſtrument, from one faculty, diuers dueties. And thus haue you my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoule, either conſidered, ſeperate: or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned with the body: and being ioyned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſuch as it exerciſeth of it ſelfe: or by thoſe organicall meanes as the body affordeth: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, next to entreate of the ſpirite, and of the bodie, with their ſeuerall actions. Of ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, as the ſoule vſeth for inſtrumentall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome are of ſubſtance, &amp; nature moſt quick, rare, and ſubtile: other ſome groſſe, ſlow, &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6813:35"/>more, or leſſe. The ſubtile inſtrument, is the ſpirite: which is the moſt vniuerſall inſtrument of the ſoule, and embraceth at ful, ſo farre as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely vſes require, al the vniuerſall faculty, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſoule is indued, and directeth it, and guideth it, vnto more particular inſtruments, for more ſpeciall and priuate vſes, as to the eye, to ſee with; to the eare to heare; to the noſe to ſmell; to the bowells, ſtomack, and liuer, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, to the heart, to maintaine life: and to other partes, to the end of propagation: this is all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſelfe ſame, one, and ſingle ſpirite. If you demaunde whereof this ſpirite is made? I take it, to be an effectuall, and pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, bred in all thinges, at what time the ſpirit of the Lord did, as it were, hatch, and breede out all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thinges, out of that Chaos mentioned in the Geneſis; which Chaos, as it was matter of corporall, and palpable ſubſtance to all thinges: ſo did it alſo, miniſter this liuely ſpirit vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diuerſe and ſeuerall, according to the diuerſitie of thoſe ſeedes, which God indued it withall: to ſome more pure: to other ſome more groſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the excellency of the creature, and dignitie of the vſes, wherto it is to be employed: from this power of God, ſprange the ſpirite of man, as I take it, raiſed from the earth, together with the body, whereby it receiued ſuch furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as it becommeth a lodging, for ſo noble a geſt, except it may ſeeme more likely, to be infuſed, and inſpired, into the bodie, with that breath of life, which was the ſoule of man, at what time, god had firſt made his corps,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6813:36"/>of the mould of the earth; which I for certayne reaſons here following am moued to make doubt of. Firſt, although it be an excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and farre excedeth the groſſe ſubſtance of our bodie; yet is it baſer, then to be attributed to ſo diuine a beginning, as from God immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; eſpecially conſidering it hath not only begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but periſheth alſo: to which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that proceedeth from God in ſuch ſpecial manner, as the ſoule did, can be ſubiect vnto. Againe, we ſee this ſpirit maintained, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the vſe of earthly creatures; and is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plentifull, or ſcanteth; as it hath want, or abundance of ſuch corporall nouriſhment. Now to drawe the originall ofſpring of the ſpirite of man from God, were in a maner to drawe from him the ſpirit of all other things, wherewith that of man is releeued: which can not be accompted to flowe from that breathing of God; both ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture pronounceth it, as peculiar to the ſoule of man: and otherwiſe, ſhould they be not inferiour in that reſpect, to the ſoules of men; which by nature, are ſet vnder his feete; and in all reſpects are farre inferiour vnto him: that I mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, too nigh approching the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God: which without impaire thereof, admitteth not ſo nigh, the acceſſe of the nature of inferiour creatures; honoring mankind ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with only of all his viſible workes. Thus then, as I take it, both the ſpirite had his firſt beginning, and is of ſuch nature as I haue declared; and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for theſe vſes. I know commonly there are accompted three ſpirits: animall, vitall, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6813:36"/>but theſe are in deede, rather diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of diuerſe offices of one ſpirit; then diuerſity of nature. For as well might they make as many as there be ſeuerall parts, and offices in the bodie; which were both falſe, &amp; ſuperfluous. Next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth the nature of the bodie, and his ſeuerall inſtruments, with their vſes; which my purpoſe is here ſo farre to touch, as it concerneth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that enſueth of my diſcourſe: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the large handling thereof to that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent hymne of Galen. Touching the vſe of the parts: the bodie being of ſubſtance groſſe, &amp; earthy; reſembleth the matter whereof it was made: and is diſtinct into diuerſe members, and diuerſe parts, for ſeuerall vſes required, partly of nature, and partly of the humane ſocietie of life: whereupon, the braine is the chiefe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſe, and motion, which it deriueth by the ſpirit before mentioned, into all the partes of the bodie; as alſo of thoughtes, and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, perfourmed by common ſenſe, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie: and ſtoring vp as it were, that which it hath conceaued in the cheſt of memorie: all which the braine it ſelfe with farther communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation exerciſeth alone. The hart is the ſeate of life, and of affections, and perturbations, of loue, or hate, like, or diſlike; of ſuch thinges as fall within compaſſe of ſenſe; either outward, or inward; in effect, or imagination onely. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the inſtrument of nouriſhment, &amp; groweth: &amp; is ſerued of the ſtomach by appetite of meats and drinkes; and of other parts, with luſt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation: &amp; as the hart, by arteries conueigheth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6813:37"/>life to all partes of the bodie: ſo the liuer, by vaines diſtributeth her faculties to euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; thereby the body enioying nouriſhment, &amp; increaſe, ſerued with naturall appetite, whereby ech part ſatisfieth it ſelfe with that, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is moſt agreable. And theſe actions are bodily performed of the ſoule, by employing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and catholicke inſtrument of ſpirit, to the mechanicall workes of the groſſe, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partes of our bodies. Thus then the whole nature of man, being compounded of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, the ſoule, and the bodie: and of the meane of ſpirits: the ſoule receaueth no other annoyance by the bodie; then the craftes man by his inſtrument: with no impeach, or impaire of cunning: but an hinderance of exerciſing the excellent partes of his skill: either when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is altogether vnapt, and ſerueth for no vſe: or in part only fit; wherby actions, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are wrought, much inferiour to the faculty of the worker: &amp; as the inſtrument is of more particular vſe, ſo is the ſoule the leſſe impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and as more generall, ſo yet more hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: both from varietie, and perfection of actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as the hart, more then the liuer: and the liuer, more then the braine: the ſtomach more then the reſt of the entrailles: and all publicke parts, more then priuate: of which ſort the ſpirit being diſordered, either in temper, or leſſened in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, or entermixed with ſtraunge vapours, and ſpirits, moſt of all, worketh annoyance, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceth the worke, and croſſeth the ſoules ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute intention: as ſhall more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE obiections which ſeeme to enforce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body farther power ouer the ſoule, then to withſtand the organicall actions, are ſuch, as are taken from the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our bodies, both in health, and in ſickneſſe. In health, we ſee how the minde altereth in apparance, not onely in action, but alſo in facultie: both in that ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſpring vp, which before were not: and thoſe through occaſions of chaunge of the body either more perfect, then otherwiſe they haue bene, or would be. This appeareth in age, and in diuerſe order of diet, and cuſtome of ſenſuall &amp; ſenſible things. Firſt touching age and yeares: we ſee in childhoode, howe childiſh the minde beareth it ſelfe, in facultie incomparable to that which afterward it ſheweth: as the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dull: the wit of blunter conceipt: memorie ſlipperie: and iudgement ſcarſe appeareth. The body growing vp, and attaining at length the height of his increaſe, all theſe giftes, more and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6813:38"/>more growe vp therewith: and (euen as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) get maturitie, and ſtrength, which is the perfection in their kind. Againe the bodie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the point of his vigor and virilitie of age, turneth all the wits and ſage counſels, into more then childiſh doring: by which alterations and chaunges, in apparance the mind both ſuffereth detriment, and againe receaueth greater ability of facultie. Neither is this only brought to paſſe through proceſſe of years: but alſo it may ſeeme that certaine faculties, which before were not, at a ſeaſon of age, put forth, and aduaunce them ſelues, which before gaue no countenaunce of ſhewe: and, except we ſhall make nature keepe idle holy day, in them were not at all: as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of propagation, of all naturall ſorts, one of the chiefeſt: which, if we ſay it ſlept, as it were in the mind, or waited a day: it ſhould ſeeme verie ridiculous, that nature ſhould be furniſhed ſo many yeares with a facultie, which it ſhould put in practiſe ſo long after: eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how particular faculties attend onely vpon ſingle and particular vſes, and haue no-other employing. If it were not before, then either ſhould the mind be imperfect at the firſt, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome part of the furniture: or elſe ſhould it ſeeme to riſe of the temper of the bodie: either of which, attribute more vnto the bodie, then of right thereto belongeth: and calleth in queſtion the immortalitie of the ſoule: except you will ſay, it is a facultie, whereof the ſoule hath no part, being common with brute beaſtes: which carieth with it theſe abſurdities. Firſt, this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6813:38"/>muſt needs haue her ſeate, either in ſoule or bodie: if it be not in ſoule, then in bodie: if in bodie; then ſhould the inſtrument poſſeſſe the facultie, which is as one would attribute the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the harmonie to the harp, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the pen, and not to the ſcriuener: eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the skilfull harps, and skilfull pens, which are dead inſtruments, and haue no being of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them ſelues. Now middle ſubiect is there none, whereto this facultie ſhould fall, except we will vainly, and againſt reaſon and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie admit mo ſoules then one in our bodies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to place any facultie otherwiſe then of diſpoſition, and aptneſſe, in the bodie, without the ſoule, were to diſturb the vniforme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that oeconomicall order, wherby our nature is ruled; in placing mo commanders then one. So we ſee, howe age, and courſe of times affect the bodie, not only by alteration of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as it ſhould ſeeme, but alſo, by breeding new. Nowe the order of life, region, and diet, ſeeme to preſſe the matter further: and as it were, to turne the mind about, with euerie blaſt of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall chaunge. We may obſerue the nature of mariners, occupied in the ſea ſurges, who haue their maners not much vnlike framed, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous and ſtormie: likewiſe the villager, who buſieth him ſelfe about his plow, and cattell on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hath his wits of no higher conceit: butchers acquainted with ſlaughter, are acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted therby to be of a more cruell diſpoſition: and therefore amongſt vs are diſcharged from iuries of life &amp; death: theſe experiences maintaine the quarel,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6813:39"/>againſt the vnmoueable, and vnchaungeable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the ſoule, whereof I haue before made mention. Howe region, and aire make demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſame, the compariſon of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and conſtant aire of Aſia, with the ſharpe &amp; vnſtable of Europe, doth declare vnto vs: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Aſians are milde, and gentle, vnfitte for warre, and giuen to ſubiection: the Europians, naturally, rough, hardie, ſtearne, right mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall impes, and harder to be ſubdued, and raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnder obedience: and of the ſame region, ſuch people as inhabite places barren, open, and dry, and ſubiect to mutabilitie of weather, are more fierce, bolder, ſharp, and obſtinate in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then people of contrary habitation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath diet leſſe part in this caſe of affecting the ſoule, then the reſt: for we ſee, howe the chearfull fruite of the vine maketh the hart me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and giueth (with moderation vſed) an edge of wit, and quickneſſe to the ſpirits: and thoſe nouriſhmentes that are moyſt, groſſe, and not firmely compacted, aggrauateth the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and maketh the conceit blunt, and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth much the faculties of the minde: which a thinner, drier, and more ſubtile foode doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine. To theſe obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be added, what alteration of minde, diuerſitie of complexion, &amp; exceſſe of the foure humours; choler, fleume, bloud, and melancholie do procure, not only to the affections, as ſanguine cheerefulneſſe, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke ſadneſſe, fleume heauineſſe, &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler anger: but to the wits, and ſuch faculties as approch nigher to the ſoueraigne partes of our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6813:39"/>nature, the mind it ſelfe: as choler procureth raſhneſſe, and vnaduiſedneſſe, with mobilitie &amp; vnſtableneſſe of purpoſe: melancholie contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pertinacie, with aduiſed deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſanguine ſimplicitie: and fleume flat fooliſhneſſe: and theſe are, ſo farre as my memory ſerueth me, all that is wonted to be obiected from the ſtate of our bodies, being in health, againſt the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, &amp; immoueable tranquillitie of our minds, and immortall, vnchaungeable, and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculties therof: which all in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I will ſatisfie with full aunſwer: nowe a fewe wordes touching the perturbarions, and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions through ſickneſſe: and ſo will I ende this Chapter, and in the next proceede to ſeuerall aunſwers. I my ſelfe haue obſerued it diuerſe times, not onely perturbation of minde to ariſe by certaine diſeaſes, whereby it fancieth, and reaſoneth diſorderly: but ſome faculties euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the ſame (neither faculties of baſe action) as for the eye, to ſee clearer after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation: and conuulſions to be helped by agues: and in feuers, the hearing more quicke then before, and the ſmelling more ſubtile: and in phrenticke perſons, the ſtrength doubled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: but alſo euen apprehenſion more perfect, and memory amended, and deliuerance of tale more free, and eloquent without all compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: which are actions of the greateſt organical practiſes of the mind: in ſuch ſort that I haue knowen children languiſhing of the ſplene, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and altered in temper, talke with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and wiſedome, ſurpaſſing thoſe tender
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6813:40"/>yeares, and their iudgement carying a marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous imitation of the wiſedome of the ancient, hauing after a ſorte, attained that by diſeaſe, which other haue by courſe of yeares: whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon I take it, the prouerbe ariſeth: that they be of ſhort life, who are of wit ſo pregnant: becauſe their bodies do receaue by nature ſo ſpeedie a ripeneſſe, as thereby age is haſtened, through a certaine temper of their bodies, either the whole, or in ſome animall part: which ripeneſſe as in other creatures, it eaſily yeeldeth to rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe, ſo in our nature, that ſpeedy maturitie haſteth to declination, and ſooner decayeth. Thus for your full ſatisfying, I haue called to minde ſuch obiections, as do chiefly giue checke vnto that which I haue propounded touching the paſſions which the body chargeth the ſoule with: now ſhall you vnderſtand the ſolution, &amp; clearing of theſe doubts. If you will deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conſideration of the effectes of poiſons in our natures, as of henbane, coriander, hemlock, night ſhade, and ſuch like, they will giue greater euidence vnto that which theſe obiections im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: by which the mind ſeemeth greatly to be altered, &amp; quite put beſide the reaſonable vſe of her ingenerate faculties during the force of the poyſons: which being maiſtred, or at leaſt reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient remedies, it recouereth thoſe gifts, whero fit was in daunger to ſuffer wracke before: and if it be true which Plato affirmeth, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths alter by change of muſicke, what ſtableneſſe ſhall we account in the mind, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is in this ſort ſubiect to euery blaſt of chaunge?</p>

               </head>
               <p>THESE doubtes before mentioned, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in ſuch order as they were in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter obiected: beginning with thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, which the ſoule ſeemeth to ſuſtaine from the bodie, while it enioyeth health, and good ſtate of all his partes: of which ſorte age &amp; yeares firſt inferre againſt vs. For the generall aunſwere whereof, as alſo for the reſt, we are to hold two pointes, as vnfallible, before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the one, is the ſimple faculty of the minde: and the other, the organicall vſe only of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſpirite: which two groundes, before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the particular diſciphiring of the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I will firſt eſtabliſh by reaſon, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to the particular ſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which hath bene obiected. Firſt, the ſimplicitie of the nature of the ſoule, more ſimple then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, argueth vnitie of facultie: ſeing all ſimple thinges by nature reiect mixture and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whatſoeuer tendeth to plurality. For, whatſoeuer is more, is diuerſe, diuerſity, ſimple thinges embrace not, neither doth diuerſity of nature admit ſo nigh copulation, as to ſettle themſelues in the ſelfe ſame ſimple, &amp; vniforme ſubiect: which if they refuſe to do, what ſhall we iudge then of will, and appetite repugnant to reaſon: and will ſometime at variance with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall appetite? how can theſe ſo contrary facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6813:41"/>concurre in one ſingle nature? That, ſimple thinges receiue neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie, nor diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the conſideration of the whole ſort of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie, and diſagreeing things, wil make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſt. All of that kinde are either ſuch as we call diuerſe, or oppoſite: diuerſe, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement is moſt gentle, haue notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſuch ſtrife, that they meete not in the ſelfe ſame ſubiect at any time: as beauty, and wiſedome, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and honeſtie: which haue their diuerſe roomes in the ſame generall nature, and do not one farther encounter the other. The other, haue one ſingle ſubiect, if they be of accidentary natures, or qualities: and there one expelleth the other: enduring no ſociety: as vertue, vice, liberality, couetouſnes, and prodigality: black, blew, yellow, and greene: light, darknes, &amp;c. And theſe are at perpetuall warre, &amp; admit no truice day, no not for a minute, &amp; ſo, becauſe they will needes poſſeſſe the ſame place, expel ech other, and are in Logick tearmed, Oppoſites. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatſoeuer the ſoule ſimple, indiuiduall, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture or compoſitiongiueth entertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſagreeing natures, muſt of neceſſity fall into one of theſe: that is, to the oppoſite or diuerſe. The oppoſite require, their owne times, and will not accord in the ſame ſubiect at once, except you will accompt relatiues of a milder diſpoſition, &amp; more ſociable then their fellowes which notwithſtanding by the diuerſe reſpect, are as farre diſioyned as the reſt. Now then, if we hold that the minde hath diuerſs faculties, then of neceſſitie muſt there be in the ſame
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6813:41"/>minde diuerſity of ſubiect: which if ther be, then is the ſimplicity thereof turned into multiplicity of ſubſtance, and compoſition of nature: a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contrarie both to the manner of the beginning of the ſoule void of mixture, and that immortall perpetuitie, wherewith it is induced. Peraduenture it may ſeeme ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the nature of thinges diuerſe, to diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them of ſubiect, ſeing ſoftnes and whitenes, white and heate, and ſuch like, being diuerſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſame ſubiect: as in ſnoe, the one and the other in molton leade, or hote yron: which doubt, becauſe it ſerueth for proofe of this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faculty, I will lay open, and make playne vnto you. Of all things ſubiect to corruption, the elementes are moſt ſimple, which being diuerſly mixed, yeeld the variety, we ſee of all compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thinges vnder heauen: theſe haue ech of them, but one quality: fire hote, ayer moiſt, earth dry, and water cold, if they ſhould haue twayne, then muſt they needes either enter communicate, or two quallities concurre with the firſt matter: entercommunication is there none: for then ſhould they not be the elements of other things ſeing they ſhould be eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts one of ech other: two qualities make ſuperfluities in the mixed, which nature eſchueth in all her worke: then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie would be here in that there ſhould in the compound be found a drynes of fire, and the like of earth: a coldnes of the earth, and the like of water: and ſo in the heat of fire, &amp; ayre: which were more then neede: ſeing ſuch quallities are ſufficiently imparted to the compound by one.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6813:42"/>Now if the elementes which after a ſort receiue compoſition of a groſſe matter and forme, do admit no diuerſe quality, much leſſe doth the minde of a more pure beginning, and ſimple ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, reiect the ſame. But how then commeth it to paſſe, that a cole is black and hard, &amp; chalk harde and white, in the ſame parte throughout, if diuerſities ſettle no nigher together? yea very well notwithſtanding. For compounded things, though they make one nature, yet are they not by reaſon of compoſition in all partes alike, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the elements ſo confuſed in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but in all partes they may be found diſtinct by their qualities ſimple or compound: which qualities although they be commonly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the whole, yet properly and cheefely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long they to the elementes whereof the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth: ſo that in one nature, diuerſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is to be conſidered. Example ſhall make it plaine: The heate of pepper riſeth of the fiery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement; the drynes and ſolidity, of ſubſtaunce which it hath of the earthie. In Rhubarb the purging vertue riſeth of the ſubtle ſubſtance, &amp; the ſtrengthening facultie of the groſſe and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Chalk is white of the aiery moiſture which it is endued with: and hath his hardnes of a ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie drynes. The roſe her rednes of a certaine temper of ſingle moiſtnes, concocted with heat: and her ſmell, of an aierie moiſtnes mixed with an earthy drynes, attenuated with heate, and vertue of the fiery element? So we ſee diuerſe thinges, which ſeeme to fall into one vniuerſall nature or ſubiect, the matter being more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6813:42"/>vined, betake them to their owne ſubiect, proper and peculiar vnto themſelues, and only by communicating their ſubſtaunce with the whole, endue it alſo with like qualities. But you will ſay: if the elements haue but one qualitye (which firſt was affirmed to the mainteynance of ſingle faculty) then is not the element of fire dry, nor of water moiſt, nor of aire warme. True: neither are they of their owne natures ſuch: but that which is in fire beſide heate, is only an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of moiſtnes: in the earth accompted cold, is an abſence only of heate: in the reſt likewiſe, and not an ingenerate quallity: more then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen may be ſaid to be moiſt, becauſe it is not dry or hote, becauſe it is not cold: which indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſeth all ſuch kinde of quallity. Now an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of one quallity, is not ſtraight waye an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the other: but only in priuants, wherof the one is a meere abſence, and of that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only, which naturally ſhould be preſent: as blindnes is not rightly ſaid of a ſtone, though it ſee not at any time. In the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary qualities, it is not ſo: but they are all quallities importing a preſence: becauſe they adioyned to the firſt matter of thinges, are the only formes of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: now abſence formeth nothing, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants are alwayes contrary to forme and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: It appeareth then, that elements which are leſſe ſimple then the ſoules of men are endued but with one faculty, and that diuerſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a diuerſe peculiar ſeat, which being taken vp in ſuch natures as will abide mixture, ſeeme as though they were of the whole mixed, when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6813:43"/>as but after a ſort only they are ſo to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Theſe two pointes being ſufficiently proued eſtabliſh euidently the ſimple and vniforme fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule: For hereby it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that by reaſon of the ſimple nature thereof, it cannot beare any mixture, or be ſupport of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe thinges: neither that diuerſe will ſo neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it together, as to dwell in one indiuiduall ſubiect. Then ſeing that they which of al the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreers, leaſt diſagree, will not ſo nighly be lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: neither can any diuerſity of faculty in the minde, in a nature ſo ſimple, and impartible be coupled together, where ther is no diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſubſtance, nor diſſent of mixture, but euery parte like the whole, and ech like other. Againe theſe pluralities being eſſentiall, can be but one: ſeing eſſence is not many, and nature alwayes farre vnlike the ſword of Delphos; which ſerued for diuerſe vſes, euer employeth one to one, and not to many: otherwiſe wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould enforce her, which (ſhe abounding with ſufficiency) refuſeth in all her actions. Moreouer being in euery part like it ſelfe, and ech parte like other, no diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude can ariſe by diſtinction of faculty. Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall if they be: then is the minde in daunger of looſing all faculty, which it cannot do ſeing it is ſubiect to no force, but of God himſelfe that made it. Now whatſoeuer naturall faculty in any thing fadeth, it is by reaſon the thing firſt fadeth which enioyeth that faculty: elſe would they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continue: wherefore the minde being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, and exempt from chaunge and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, her faculty is alſo eſſentiall, and of like
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6813:43"/>perpetuity: I neede not yeeld reaſon why con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary faculties, or ſuch as we call diſparates in logicke, can haue no roome in a nature ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the ſoule is, both in reſpect of the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance within themſelues, and vnitie of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: ſeing ſuch as are diuerſe only refuſe that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation and neighbourhood. Thus much ſhal ſuffice to proue the ſimple faculty of the ſoule: it followeth to proue the ſpirite and body to be wholly organicall: by organicall I meane a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition &amp; aptnes only, without any free worke or action, otherwiſe then at the mindes comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: elſe ſhould there be mo beginninges &amp; cauſes of action then one, in one nature: which popularity of adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nature will none of, nor yet with any holygarcicall or mixt: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth only by one ſouerainty: the reſt being vaſſals at the beck of the ſoueraigne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The kindes of inſtruments are of two ſorts: the one dead in it ſelfe, and deſtitute of all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as a ſaw before it be moued of the workman, and a ſhip before it be ſtirred with winde, and hoiſed of ſaile: the other ſorte is liuely, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in it ſelfe aptnes, and diſpoſition of motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as the hound to hunt with, and the hauke to fowle with, both caried with hope of pray: the hand, to moue at our pleaſure, and to vſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of inſtrument or toole. The ſecond ſort of theſe twaine, is alſo to be diſtinguiſhed in twaine, whereof the one obtaineth power in it ſelfe, and requireth derection only, as the beaſt, and fowle aboue mentioned: and the other not only direction, but impulſion alſo from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6813:44"/>vertue, and forcible power: as the motion of the hand, and the variety of the hand actions do moſt euidently declare. Of theſe three kinds of inſtruments, I place the ſpirit and bodie both to the mind, as the ſaw or axe in the workmans hand, or to the lute touched of the Muſician (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſundry qualities &amp; conditions of the inſtruments of the body) in the thirde ſort; but ſo, as the ſpirit, in compariſon of the bodie, fareth as the hand to the dead inſtrumentes. Of the firſt ſort they are not, becauſe they partake of life: of the ſecond they may not be, becauſe of them ſelues they haue no impulſion, as it appeareth euidently in animall and voluntarie actions, and (although more obſcurely to be ſeene) in ſuch as be called naturall. For the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being either withdrawne from the outwarde parts by vehement paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of griefe, or ouer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally ſcattered by ioy, or waſted by paine, the outward partes not only faile in their ſenſe and motion, but euen nouriſhment &amp; growth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are hindered: and contrarily, though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be preſent, except the part be alſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not only feeling is impaired, &amp; ſuch actions as require ſenſe and motion, but alſo concoction and nouriſhment. Againe, the ſpirit it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impulſion of minde lieth idle in the bodie. This appeareth in animall actions more plainly: as the mind imploying vehemently the ſpirit an other way, we neither ſee that is ſet before our eyes, nor heare, nor feele that which otherwiſe with delight, or diſpleaſure, would vehemently affect vs. In naturall actions and parts, it is more
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6813:44"/>obſcure: either becauſe the ſpirit can not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo ſeparated by the order of nature, being rooted ſo in the part, or becauſe the verie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſoule in an organicall bodie, without further facultie or action, carieth the life withal, and is not ſubiect to arbitrement and will: as the royall eſtate of a Prince, moueth ſilence, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and expectation, although there be no charge, or commaundement therof giuen, nor ſuch purpoſe of preſence: ſo life lieth rather in the eſſence, or ſubſtance of the ſoule, giuing it to a fit organed body; rather then by any ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie reſident therein. except we may thinke that leſſe portion of ſpirit ſerueth for life onely, then for life, ſenſe, and motion, &amp; ſo the parts, contented with ſmaller prouiſion thereof, are entertained with life, though ſenſe and mouing require more plenty. But howſoeuer this be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in naturall actions, the mind tranſporting the ſpirits another way by ſudden conceit, ſtudy or paſſion. yet moſt certaine it is, if it holde on long, and releaſe not, the nouriſhment will alſo faile, the increaſe of the body diminiſh, and the flower of beautie fade, and finally death take his fatall hold: which commeth to paſſe, not onely by expence of ſpirit, but by leauing deſtitute the parts, whereby declining to decay, they become at length vnmeete for the entertainement of ſo noble an inhabitant as is the ſoule, of ſtocke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, of immortall perpetuity, and exempt from all corruption. Then ſeeing neither body, nor ſpirit are admitted in the firſt, or ſecond ſort of inſtruments, they fall to the third kinde, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6813:45"/>being liuely, or at the leaſt apt for life, require direction, and alſo foreine impulſion: foraine, in reſpect of them ſelues, deſtitute of facultie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then diſpoſition: but inward and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, in that it proceedeth from a naturall power, (reſident in theſe corporall members) which we call the ſoule: not working as ingens, by a force voide of skill and cunning in it ſelfe, &amp; by a motion giuen by deuiſe of the Mecheniſt: but farre otherwiſe indued with ſcience, &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the mouer: as if Architas had bin him ſelfe within his flying doues, &amp; Vulcanne within his walking ſtooles, and the mouing engine as it were animated with the minde of the worker, therein excelling farre all induſtrie of art. For here the natural Apelles painteth as well within as without; and Phydias is no leſſe curious in poliſhing the entralles, and partes withholden from the viewe, then in garniſhing the outward apparance, and ſhew of his frame: and which is yet more, here the crafts man entreth him ſelfe into all the parts of the worke, and neuer would relinquiſh the ſame. Although we place the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and body in the third kind of inſtruments, yet is there great oddes, betwixt theſe two. For the ſpirit anſwereth at full all the organicall actions of the ſoule, &amp; hath in it no diſtinction of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: the body is of more particular vſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſundry parts, ech of them framed of peculiar duties, as the mind and ſpirit employeth them. The ſpirit is quicke, nimble, and of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous celeritie of motion; the body, ſlow, dull, and giuen to reſt of it ſelfe: the ſpirit the verie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6813:45"/>hand of the ſoule; the body &amp; bodily members like flailes, ſawes, or axes in the hand of him that vſeth them. For as we ſee God hath geuen vs reaſon for all particular faculties, and hand for all inſtruments, of pleaſure, of neceſſitie, of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, of defence, that thereby, although man be borne without couering, without teeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hoofe or horne, only with tender nailes, and thoſe neither in faſhion, nor temper fit for fight: yet he clotheth him ſelfe, both againſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt warme, againſt force of weapon with coate of ſteele, and maketh vnto him ſelfe weapons of warre, no tuſh, no horne, no hoofe, no ſnout of elephant in force comparable thereunto: ſo the ſpirits of our bodies, and this hand of our ſouls, though it be but one, yet handleth it all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of our body: and it being light, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and yeelding, yet forceth it the heauieſt, &amp; groſſeſt, &amp; hardeſt parts of our bodies, chewing with the teeth, and ſtriking with the fiſt, &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring downe with the thruſt of ſhoulder, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that which ſtandeth firme, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alone the force of all the members: ſeeth with the eye, heareth with the eares, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth organically with the braine, diſtributeth life with the hart, and nouriſhment with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and whatſoeuer other bodely action is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. This hand is applied to the groſſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the effect brought to paſſe, yet not abſolutely of it ſelfe, but by impulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mind, which is placed the only agent, abſolute and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne not onely in reſpect of commaunding, but alſo offacultie &amp; execution. This place then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6813:46"/>beareth the ſpirits among the inſtruments; and as the ſoule is one, and indued with one only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, ſo the ſpirit is alſo one, and embraceth that one faculty, and diſtributeth it among the corporall members, as euerie one according to his diuerſe temper or frame, or both ioyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is meete this way or that way to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; yet ſo that by degrees, and diuerſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, it is communicated from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and chiefe partes with the reſt. As firſt life and vitall ſpirit, from the hart to the reſt by arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: nouriſhment and growth, from the liuer by vaines: ſenſe and motion, from the brayne by nerues: not confuſedly, and by equall portions adminiſtred to all alike, but by ſuch geometrical proportion as iuſtice requireth, and is neceſſary for the office of euerie part. Thus you ſee what nature the ſpirit is of, and to what vſe it ſerueth in our nature, and of what ſort of inſtrument it is to be accompted. The corporall part and mé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, becauſe their ſeruices be many are diſtinct into diuerſitie of ſhapes and tempers, to anſwer all turnes; wherof ſome be more generall, and beare as it were office ouer the reſt; as the heart is moſt generall, and extendeth it ſelfe to all the parts, with this prerogatiue aboue the liuer: that a part may liue for a time, and not be nouriſhed, nether yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any part be nouriſhed without life. This rule it exerciſeth by the miniſtery of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries extended in branches throughout the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and ſcattering the ſpirit of life throughout. Next the hart in vſe and office towardes other members, the liuer obtaineth the ſecond place:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6813:46"/>by whoſe vertue, through the operation of the ſoule, and that ſpirituall hand, nouriſhment, and preparation of aliment is perfourmed in all the parts, vpon whom attendeth the ſtomach &amp; the reſt of the entralls vnder the midriffe. The third place is allotted to the braine, which by his ſenſe and motion guideth, and directeth the partes maintained with life and nouriſhment: his ſenſe is of two ſorts, and ſo his motion, both inward, &amp; outward. The inward ſenſe, thinketh, imagineth and remembreth, and is practiſed with that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar temper and frame which the braine hath proper, as alſo his internall motion not much vnlike the panting of the hart. The outward ſenſe and motion of ſinewes is deriued from it into all parts that require ſenſe, or mouing. The other parts ſubiect to theſe three principall and their miniſters ſerue their owne turnes only, and are of priuate condition; except the ſoule command a voluntarie or mixed action: as to walke, to go &amp;c. or to take breath, giue paſſage of ſtoole, or vrine.</p>

               <p>THvs haue you theſe partes, and organicall vſes diſtinct: and if it ſeeme yet difficult vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, to conceaue, how one ſimple faculty can diſcharge ſuch multiplicitie of actions, way with me a litle, by a compariſon of ſimilitude, the truth of this point, &amp; accordingly accept it. We ſee it euident in automaticall inſtrumentes, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6813:47"/>clockes, watches, and larums, howe one right and ſtraight motion, through the aptneſſe of the firſt wheele, not only cauſeth circular motion in the ſame, but in diuerſe others alſo: and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but diſtinct in pace, and time of motion: ſome wheeles paſſing ſwifter then other ſome, by diuerſe raſes: nowe to theſe deuiſes, ſome other inſtrument added, as hammer, and bell, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another right motion ſpringeth therof, as the ſtroke of the hammer, but ſound alſo oft repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deliuered it at certaine times by equall pauſes; and that either larume or houres accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the partes of the clocke are framed. To theſe if yet moreouer a directorie hand be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; this firſt, and ſimple, and right motion by weight or ſtraine, ſhall ſeeme not only to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of deliberate ſound, &amp; to counterfet voyce, but alſo to point with the finger as much as it hath declared by ſound. Beſides theſe we ſee yet a third motion with reciprocation in the balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the clocke. So many actions diuerſe in kinde riſe from one ſimple firſt motion, by reaſon of variety of ioynts in one engine. If to theſe you adde what wit can deuiſe, you may finde all the motion of heauen with his planets counterfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in a ſmall modill, with diſtinction of time &amp; ſeaſon, as in the courſe of the heauenly bodies. And this appeareth in ſuch ſorte as carie their motion within them ſelues. In water workes I haue ſeene a mill driuen with the winde, which hath both ſerued for griſt, and auoyding of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water out of drowned fennes and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; which to an American ignorant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6813:47"/>would ſeeme to be wrought by a liuely actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery part, and not by ſuch a generall mouer as the wind is, which bloweth direct, &amp; foloweth not by circular motion of the mill ſaile. Nowe if this be brought to paſſe in artificiall practiſes, &amp; the varietie of action inferre not ſo many facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but meere diſpoſitions of the inſtrumentes: let the ſimilitude ſerue to illuſtrat that vnto you, whereto the reaſons before alleaged, may with more force of proofe induce you. If yet you be not ſatisfied, (for melancholicke perſons are for the moſt part doubtfull and leaſt aſſured) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ye acknowledge the truth hereof in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall actions: yet in ſuch as require no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, iudge otherwiſe; that ſcruple alſo by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, I will take away and make it plaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, referring you for ſtrength of reaſon to that which hath bene aforſayd. Before, I ſhewed the varietie of action, to ſpring of diuerſitie of inſtrument; now, where there is no inſtrument, what diuerſitie (ſay you) can there be? &amp; yet to giue but one action to the ſoule, were to depriue it of many goodly exerciſes, whereby it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the creator, thankfully acknowledgeth his goodneſſe, and directeth it ſelfe to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, beſides thoſe ſpirituall offices, which the ſoules departed out of this life, in loue performe to ech other, with that knowledge of eternall things? If you require reaſon of proofe, the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the ſoule, and the nature of diuerſe things will make aunſwer: if of illuſtration and compariſon of ſimilitude: then conſider, howe with one viewe, a man beholdeth both top, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6813:48"/>bottome of height, and both endes of length at once, the ſituation of the thing being conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereunto; yet are there neither diuerſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor diuerſe inſtruments: the Sunne both ripeneth and withereth, and with an influence it bringeth forth mettals, trees, herbes, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſpringeth from the earth; ſome things it ſofteneth, and other ſome it hardeneth: other ſome it maketh ſweete, and other ſome bitter: an hammer driueth in, and driueth out, it looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth &amp; faſteneth, it maketh &amp; it marreth, not with diuerſity of faculty, keping the ſame waight temper, and faſhion it had before, but onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly applied, and vſed vpon diuerſe matters: ſo many vſes ariſe of one inſtrument. Moreouer, if a man were double fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted (as the Poets haue fained Ianus) &amp; the inſtruments diſpoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, the ſame facultie of ſight would addreſſe it ſelfe to ſee both before and behind at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which nowe it doth by turning. As theſe actions of ſo ſundry ſorts require no diuerſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, but chaunge of ſubiect, and altered ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: ſo the mind, in action wonderfull, and next vnto the ſupreme maieſtie of God, and by a peculiar maner proceeding from him ſelfe, as the things are, ſubiect vnto the apprehenſion, &amp; action thereof: ſo the ſame facultie varieth not by nature, but by vſe only, or diuerſity of thoſe thinges whereto it applieth it ſelfe: as the ſame facultie applied to differring things, diſcerneth: to thinges paſt, remembreth: to thinges future, foreſeeth: of preſent things determineth: and that which the eye doth by turning of the head,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6813:48"/>beholding before, behind, and on ech ſide, that doth the mind freely at once (not being hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor reſtrained by corporall inſtrument) in iudging, remembring, foreſeeing, according as the thinges preſent them ſelues vnto the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration therof. For place mo then one, &amp; where will you ſtay, and how will you number them? &amp; why are there not as well three ſcore, as three? If you meaſure them by kindes of actions, they are indefinite, and almoſt infinite, and can not beare any certaine rate in our natures: ſeeing ſuch as are voluntarie, riſe vpon occaſions, and neceſſitie vncertaine: and naturall are diuerſe in euery ſeuerall part, and ſo according to their number are multiplied, and of them ſundrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being performed, as to attract, to concoct, to retaine, to expell, to aſſimilate, agglutinate, &amp;c. not generally, but the peculiar and proper nouriſhment, the number would fill vp Eraſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes ſiue to count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. Wherfore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this argument, and to leaue you reſolued in this point, let the facultie be one, and plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vſe, &amp; diuerſitie of thoſe things whereabout it was conuerſaunt: otherwiſe the mind ſhalbe diſtracted into parts, which is whole in euery part: and admit mixture, which is moſt ſimple: and become ſubiect of diuerſe qualities, which are diſtinct in nature, and communicated by mixture of ſubſtances whereto they belong, &amp; not confuſed together in one, againſt nature. Thus you haue mine opinion touchinge theſe three parts: of ſoule, of ſpirit, and bodie, with their peculiar actions, and howe euerie one is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6813:49"/>ſeuerally brought to paſſe: which I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary firſt to make plaine, before I entred into particular aunſwer to the former obiections, as the grounde of the ſolution, and rule whereto the particular aunſwers are to be ſquared. So then I take generally the ſoule to be affected of the bodie and ſpirit, as the inſtrument hindreth the worke of the artificer; which is not by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his skill, or diminiſhing his cunning, but by deprauing the action through vntowardneſſe of toole, and fault of inſtrument. This in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following, I will particularly apply to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obiections.</p>

               <p>AS for thoſe faculties which age ſeemeth not only to alter, but alſo to breede, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together organicall, and are not of this or that ſorte: or appeare not, becauſe, the faculty ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth violence or wanteth, but becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes as yet lacked ſuch diſpoſition, as the ſoule requireth, being altogether vnapt, or elſe although faulty in parte, yet employed as they may be: whereupon the actions become imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. As the brayne in a child new borne, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with humidity cauſeth diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible obiectes for 40 dayes, as ſayeth Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Ariſtotle, to be ſo dull, that they feele not, though they be rubbed, neither laugh they, though they be tickled, as afterward they doe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6813:49"/>both, and take pleaſure in the one, and as we be affected after a mixt ſorte in the other: which obſcurity of ſence, ioyned with want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſenſible thinges, and comparing of their euents, with want of exerciſe, is the cheefe cauſe of that ſimplicity of children in affaires of this life, wherein prudence is moſt conuerſant. For better conceiuing of which point, you are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, or call to minde, how the ſoule hath certaine principles of knowledge ingenerate, called Criteria of the Greekes, and certaine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from obſeruation of ſenſible thinges, and from them framed, agreeably to thoſe grounded principles and ingenerate knowledge of the ſoule. Theſe Criteria diſcerne betwixt good and badde, trueth and falſhood, and are euer firme, and certayne in themſelues, and are abuſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the imperfection of ſuch inſtrumentes, by which the diſcretion and report of outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes do paſſe. From this do ſpringe three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall actions, whereby the whole courſe of reaſon is made perfect. Firſt, that which the greekes cal Sintereſis, the ground, whereupon the practiſe of reaſon conſiſteth, aunſwering the propoſition in a ſillogiſme: the conſcience applying, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: and of them both, the third, a certaine trueth concluded: theſe partes the ſoule doth without inſtrument of body, and neuer faileth therein, ſo farre as the naturall principles lead, or outward obiectes be ſincerely taken, &amp; truely reported to the minds conſideration. From the practiſes of theſe ingenerate, &amp; infallible grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds riſe all the knowledge of outward thinges, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6813:50"/>humane ſciences: and as a rule being but one ruleth equally gold, timber, and ſtone, and the ballance peaſeth all kinde of waighty things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, ſo theſe applied to practiſes of life, &amp; wordly buſines, haue ingendred prudence, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection: in the conuerſation of men, and maner of behauiour, the morall vertues: In the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of voluntary actions, diuerſe artes and ſciences, and aboue all, diſpoſeth it ſelfe to the worſhip and adoration of God, in ſome one ſort or other: the right manner whereof depending vpon his expreſſe oracles, and operation of his ſpirite aboue nature: the want wherof hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many rites, and ſundry ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as are, and haue bene accompted religion in the world, the humaine ſenſe being neither able to deliuer miſteries of ſuch diuine quality vnto the minde, and thoſe groundes and rules being feebled, and crooked in that kinde, by the degenerate ſtate of our firſt parentes. So then that wherein chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſeeme to fayle through age in reaſon, is not that the faculty is vnripe, or to ſeeke: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the exerciſe thereof through neceſſity of life, is employed in ſuch thinges, as ſenſe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before acquainted with, maketh offer therof to the mindes iudgement confuſed, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth one thing for another, or the ſame not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely: ſo the fault is in organicall action, and not in ingenerate faculty, which organe hath not yet, the full diſpoſition of all his partes, or miſtaketh for want of experience, that which it reporteth: according to which the minde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, directed by her ingenerate ſcience:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6813:50"/>which both are manifeſt in tender yeares: whoſe braines are ſo ſoked, and drowned with naturall moiſture, that in them the animall inſtrumentes are moſt feeble, eſpecially ſuch as require vſe of the braine it ſelfe the moiſteſt part of all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the other actions which ſtand of a paſſiue diſpoſition (as outward ſenſe) being litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereby hindered. This appeareth plainly in thoſe things which children do diſtinctly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, which their ingenerate ſcience, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the minde, doth clearely, and perfectly conceiue and iudge, as the auncient: as a child knowing the heate of fire, will as readely iudge of the perrill, as the wiſeſt Senatour, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road of a borderer, or the politick captaine, of the vnequall encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with his enimy, by place, occaſion, of time, or what opportunity ſo euer, &amp; hauing felt the heat thereof, will as preſently iudge the ſentence falſe, affirmeth it could, as the ſharpeſt witted philoſopher, the moſt capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ſubtileſt Sorites of Stilpo. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer we dayly ſee in children a Preludium as it were, &amp; draught of the graueſt actions, that in earneſt do afterward fall out in our life, only the thing altered wherin the minde is occupied. For they will both counterfet the wiſe counſeller, &amp; the valiant captaine: the Maieſty of a prince, &amp; duety of homage and ſubiection, and giue ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for the moſt part of that hope in their youth, as a modill, wherof age afterward maketh full proofe: which as it appeareth in all, ſo moſt notably in the worthy Cyrus, of whoſe educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Zenophon writeth. Now it alſo appeareth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6813:51"/>in children (as their organicall partes are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,) more quickely, to apprehend, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe childiſh matters wherewith they buſie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues or they therewith more or leſſe acquainted: which both concurred in Cyrus: his body being as it ſhould ſeeme of excellent temper, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſonne of a King, at thoſe dayes the great maiſter of the world: as for his education, it was nothing elſe, but an acquainting of his minde with thoſe excellent partes of a prince, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being at full hability of inſtrument, he put in practiſe, as his gouernment required. This called Plato a remembrance only, and calling to minde againe of thoſe thinges, which the ſoule, by being plunged in this gulfe of the body, had forgotten: which I ſo farre otherwiſe count of as neither do I hold that the ſoule had euer before any knowledge of theſe outward thinges, and ſuch whereof the ſenſes be motions, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from this corporall ſociety, ſhall haue any knowledge, or remembrance of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, at leaſt in this maner, but only is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in thoſe exerciſes which require no bodely organ, till the reſurrection, when ioyned to the body againe, as after a ſleepe, it recondeth with freſh memory what it hath done good or euill, with conſcience excuſing or accuſing: becauſe they riſe of ſenſe, and ſenſible obiectes, and haue no farther vſe then in humane ſociety, which ſuch actions do vphold: neither carieth it away more then it brought, as whereto nothing can be added. That then, which generally I aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, touching organical practiſes peculiar to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6813:51"/>and ſpirite, the ſame doe I apply particularly to the obiection from age, and ſuch diſcretion as it bringeth with it; euen that all ſuch are actions depending vpon inſtrument, wherunto the faule whatſoeuer is to be aſcribed, and not vnto any faculty of the minde, (which neuer ſuffereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe nor decreaſe, or any other kinde of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,) or elſe vnto want of experience, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe things, which greater yeares me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with: wherein the ſenſes both externall, and internall by vſe being perfect, like as a true loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe repreſenteth the countenance to the eye, in all pointes as nature, hath framed it, ſo offer they the relation true &amp; diſtinct from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thinges: whereof the minde deliuereth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and ſentence: willeth good thinges, and refuſeth the contrarie, whatſoeuer it ſeemeth to do otherwiſe, through the inordinate inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the ſeates of vnruly appetite, and diſorderly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, far different from that which the minde it ſelfe willeth entirely, free from all perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That which I haue anſwered concerning the animall actions, fitteth alſo the obiection of pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pagation: for ſuch partes haue not as yet their naturall diſpoſition thereunto: neither doth the animall partes make ſuch diſcretion in male and female, whereof that appetite ariſeth, although the ſight and countenance and perſon of eche party be all one: neither is any faculty idle at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, (the inſtruments only of ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take refreſhing by reſt,) eſpecially ſo many yeares: which muſt needes enſue, if it were a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty diſtinct, and not rather according to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6813:52"/>aptnes of inſtrument, a peculiar exerciſe only. For nature employeth all to the vttermoſt, and giueth neuer ouer, except it be more cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly to lay hand to the worke againe, which to propagation needeth not, no vſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene thereof at all before. If you ſay it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of an internall conceite, take this withall, that the conceite is taken from an external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, together with a diſpoſed parte thereunto, which ſo ſoone as it is perfected to the vſe: the minde being alwayes occupied, and in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motion, employeth that alſo whereunto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally it is bent. The obiection riſing from cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of life in ſaylers, butchers, and ploughme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, receiueth the ſame anſwere. For their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of action through continuall practiſe of ſuch artes, maketh them in common ſenſe, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and affection, to deliuer thinges vnto the minde after an impure ſort, alwayes ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their ordinary trade of life. This is that putteth of butchers from iuries, and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of life and death amongeſt men: who although they know there is difference betwixt man and beaſt, the cauſe of the one and the vſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the giltles priſoner, and the innocent lamb, yet they being accuſtomed with ſlaughter, the difference is not ſo ſincerely taken, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection not indifferent in ſuch a caſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from ſuch capitall cauſes they are remoued. The mariner as the Europians are more rough, bold, hardie, inconſtant, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Aſians, through inconſtancy of the aire, and tempeſtiouſnes of the regions: ſo the incertainty of the weather,

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6813:53"/>of our bodies are repaired, beſides that which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of the internall ſpirit of aliment, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drunke in vs, and paſſeth into all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of our intrailes, ſtirreth our humours, and diuerſly affecteth all our organical partes: as the aire and ſoile, drie, open, &amp; barren, maketh the bodies firme, hard, and compact, and the ſpirits pure &amp; ſubtile, wherby what action ſoeuer is to be performed of them, is more quicke, nimble, and prompt, eſpecially if nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, then of people of contrary habitation.

               </head>
               <p>THE perturbations are taken commonlie to riſe of melancholy, choler, bloud, or fleume; ſo that men of haſtie diſpoſition we call chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke: of ſad, melancholicke: of heauie and dull flegmaticke: of merie and chearfull, ſanguine:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6813:53"/>and not onely the common opinion ſo taketh it but theſe affections are accompted of the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians for tokens of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexions, &amp; ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours raigning in the bodie. Let vs conſider therfore, whether the truth be as they hold it, &amp; perturbations haue no other fountaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe humours. What theſe humours are, we haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared, and how they are ingendred: the vſe of them is to nouriſh the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and to repaire the continuall expence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of through trauelles of this life; beſides that, which the naturall heat continually conſumeth. The perturbations thus moue vs, diſturbe our counſels, &amp; diſquiet our bodies on this ſort. Firſt occaſion riſeth from outward things, wherin we either take pleaſure, or wherewith we are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: this obiect is caried to the internall ſenſes from the outward; which if it be a matter ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall onely, the minde vſeth to impart it to the hart, by the organicall internall ſenſes, which with ioy embraceth it, or with indignation, and miſlike refuſeth it; if of ſuch points, as it ſelfe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, without their helpe it giueth knowledge thereof to the hart by the ſpirits, which either embraceth the ſame, impelled by the minds wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or reiecteth it with miſlike and hatred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her nilling. But before I proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Chapter, it ſhall be neceſſarie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you, all the ſortes of perturbations, which being diſtinguiſhed vnto claſſes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per families, ſhall deliuer great light vnto vs: both in laying open their natures, and alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the nature of the humours, make
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6813:54"/>more cleare demonſtration, what likelihoode they carie to be effects of ſuch cauſes as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are. All perturbations are either ſimple, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of the ſimple. Simple are ſuch, as haue no mixture of any other perturbation: and thoſe are either primitiue, and firſt, or deriuatiue and drawne from them. The primitiues haue like or diſlike properties vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Loue &amp; hate are the firſt kinds and primitiues of the reſt: loue being a vehement liking, and hate a vehement affection of diſliking: from theſe ſpringe all the deriuatiues, which ariſe either from loue, or hate, like, or diſlike. From loue and liking of a preſent good, ſpringeth ioy and reioycing; if it be to come, hope entertaineth the hart with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. From diſlike and hate: if the thing be euill as the other good, (in deede or in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it skilleth not) and preſent, riſeth heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hart, and diſpoſition of ſadneſſe: if it be a future euill, feare riſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miſlike of hate; &amp; theſe I take to be all the ſimple perturbations. The compound, are ſuch as haue part of the ſimple by mixture: and that either of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues with ſimple ones only, or mixed with deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiues. Such are mixed with primitiues onely, are either mixed vnequally of loue and liking, or of miſlike &amp; hate; or equally of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. Of the firſt ſort, &amp; taking more part of liking, is the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which moueth vs to laugh; this we cal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe wherwith we with ſome diſcontentment, take pleaſure at that, which is done or ſayd ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly: of which ſort are deeds, or wordes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely or vnmeet, and yet moue no compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6813:54"/>as when a man ſcaldeth his mouth with his pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or an hote pie, we are diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with the hurt, yet ioye at the euent vnexpected of the partie, and that we haue eſcaped it; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence commeth laughter: which becauſe it exceedeth the miſlike of the thing that hurteth, burſteth out into vehemency on that ſide, and procureth that merie geſture. If on the other ſide the thing beſuch as the miſlike excedeth the ioy we haue of our freedome from that euill, then riſeth pity and compaſſion: and theſe perturbations take their beginninges of the primitiues vnequally mixed, whereby one of them doth after a ſorte obſcure the other. The other are ſuch as haue equall mixture, and thoſe are enuie and ieloſie. If the thing we loue be ſuch as we haue not part of, then ſpringeth an hate or miſlike of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie who enioyeth that we want and like of, and ſo breedeth enuy, a griefe for the proſperity of another, or good ſucceſſe whatſoeuer, wherein we haue no part. If it be ſuch benefit as we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, and are grieued it ſhould be communicated with other, and wherein we refuſe a partener, that is called ielouſie: and is ſeene manifeſt in ſuch, as at amorouſly affected, or of aſpiring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and theſe are compounded of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues alone, like or miſlike, loue, or hate. Thoſe which are mixed of primitiues, or deriuatiues, are of two ſortes, according as the primitiues: that is to ſay mixed of loue or hate. Nowe loue mixed with hope, breedeth truſt: with loue and feare diſtruſt. Hate or miſlike compounded with hope, breedeth anger: whereby we are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:6813:55"/>with that miſliketh vs, and by hope of being ſatisfied of that, that offered the diſlike, are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to anger the affection of reuenge. If it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing wherein we haue diſpleaſed our ſelues with, it is called ſhame: if it be compounded with feare, it is called baſhfulneſſe; if the miſlike be taken from another, the compoſition is of hate and anger, and thereof ſpringeth, malice. Thus haue you the perturbations compounded of primitiue paſſions with their deriuatiues. Of deriuatiues betwixt them ſelues ariſe diſpaire, and confident aſſurance. Diſpaire is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of heauineſſe, griefe and feare: the other of ioy and hope: thus haue you after my minde the perturbations raunged into their ſeuerall claſſes: to the ende, the affinitie of cauſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (if any be) betwixt them and the humours, may more eaſily appeare; if none be, as in deed there is none, then the contrarie truth may with greater euidence, approue it ſelfe vnto your iudgement. For loue or liking, hate or miſlike, being but two primitiue paſſions, howe may we with reaſon referre them to the humours, which are foure: and if the perturbations ſhould riſe of humour, then ſhould they aunſwer ech other neither mo nor fewer: and as the one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, primitiue and deriuatiue, ſo ſhould the humours be at the inſtant of thoſe paſſions, which is impoſſible: or if they be not at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant mixed, but before, the hart ſhould not lye indifferent to all paſſions, and the mixture being once made, by what meanes ſhould they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnmixed? Againe if they riſe of humour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6813:55"/>then ſhould thoſe parts wherein humours moſt abound, be inſtruments of paſſions, and ſo the gall of anger, and the ſplene of ſadneſſe, and not the hart, which is the ſeate of all thoſe affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which we call perturbations: from which both of thoſe partes, are parted by the midriffe. But you will ſay: theſe affections riſe of the temper of the hart, and that temper of the humour. Not ſo: for either the affections riſe of the frame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of the hart, or elſe at the leaſt ioyned with the temper: nowe the humours haue ſo ſmall force in making temper, and framing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, that them ſelues are all therof framed, the ſpirits applying the temper of the organical parts to that buſineſſe. Touching the frame of the hart, ſuch as haue bin moſt couragious haue it of ſubſtance firme, compact, and of qualitie moderate, the poores neither ouerlarge nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: in which points the temper and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion hath no vſe: but the frame alone. Againe, theſe paſſions being wrought of the heart by a certaine enlarging of it ſelfe, if it be pleaſed, and cloſing, if it be contrarily affected: which be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions not of complexion, but of frame &amp; ſhape, make ſufficient proofe againſt the complexion in this parte, which only beareth it ſelf affected to that which it toucheth, altering it, if it be of victualls into humours, and the humours into the ſubſtance of the body, which it indueth with the ſame complexion. Againe it fareth oft times that this or that humour aboundeth by diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered diet, yet the complexion all one; neither purgations of humour alter complexion, a fixed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6813:56"/>thing, ingenerate by nature, &amp; not ouerthrown but by ſome venimous qualitie direct oppoſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or long cuſtome of other diſorder, whereby nature is ſupplanted in time, &amp; grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with which firſt is miſliked, is ouermatched with a counterfet nature, gotten by vſe of that otherwiſe is vnnaturall. Theſe points might be more at large layed open, if it were neceſſarie, or they did not withdraw from the purpoſe I haue in hand, to reſt more vppon them. But how then cometh it to paſſe, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke perſons are more ſad then other, &amp; cholericke more angrie &amp;c. if theſe humoures beare no ſway herein? For anſwer of which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, you are to vnderſtand that both ioye and ſadneſſe are of two ſorts, as alſo the reſt ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from them: the one is naturall riſing vpon an outward accaſion, if the bodie be well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and faultles in his inſtruments, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect made no greater nor leſſe then it is in deed, and the hart, aunſwer proportionally therunto: the other is vnnaturall, and diſordered, riſing either of no outward occaſion, but from inward deluſion, or elſe ſuch as are (by fault of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſenſes, or euil diſpoſition of the hart) otherwiſe taken then the obiect requireth. In this ſecond kind, the humours ſeeme to haue greateſt rule, which whether they haue ſo, as cauſes or not, &amp; in what reſpect they entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, I wil now make plaine vnto you. Of the firſt ſort of perturbations naturall, and riſing vppon euident occaſion I neede ſtand leſſe vpon, ſeing as the hart is by outward cauſes moued, ſo is it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6813:56"/>neither more affected of this humour then of that, neither can there be any ſuch ſudden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of humours be wrought in the bodie, whereby through anger choler ſhould diſioyne him ſelfe from his fellow humours, and poſſeſſe the hart: or melancholie in cauſes of griefe, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, or feare, eſpecially an humour of groſſe &amp; earthy partes, as it were the very lies of the reſt of the bloud. Againe, it were verie contrarie to reaſon, to attribute an action of ſo neceſſary vſe, as are the perturbations vnto that, which is no organe of our bodies, but only matter of foode and nouriſhment; of which ſort are all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, keeping them ſelues within compaſſe of good temper. Moreouer if through anger the hart be moued firſt, then is it firſt troubled, and the perturbations wrought, before the humour receaue impreſſion: if the humor admit firſt the motion of the thing louely or hurtfull, &amp; impart that to the heart, then ſhould it receiue a degree of excellencie aboue the hart in this reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more attendant vpon the ſpirit, the chiefe ſteward of this facultie, then the hart is, which next to the ſpirit hath greateſt place in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay you, haue the Philoſophers defined anger a boyling of the bloud about the hart? if it be according to that definition, then the more cholericke a man is, ſo much the more angry is he: becauſe the choler is firſt apt to boyle, as it were brimſtone to the match, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other humours. That definition of anger, is to be taken not by proper ſpeech, but by a metonymicall phraſe, whereby the cauſe is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6813:57"/>attributed to the effect. For firſt the heart mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, kindled with anger, then the bloud riſeth, which being cholericke encreaſeth the heate, but addeth nothing to the paſſion: nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſenſibly feele an extraordinarie heate about our hearts when we be moued to angrie paſſions, therefore they haue defined anger by that effect: which boyling, riſeth not of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the bloud, but by a ſtrife of a contrary motion in the heart at one time, the one being a contraction of it ſelfe, and a retraite of the bloud and certaine ſpirits not farre of: with miſlike of that offendeth, as in feare, which commandeth euen from the extreme and vtmoſt parts: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it gathereth great heate within, which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out againe with reuenge, cauſeth through vehemency, &amp; ſuddenneſſe of the motion, that boyling of heat, procured of anger: eſpecially if it be not deliuered by word and deede, whereby liberty is giuen for the paſſion to breake foorth, which reſtrained in any ſort, breedeth an agony of ſuch feruency, as it may reſemble the ſcalding of a boyling chaldron not vncouered, or an hote furnace cloſed vp in all vents. Moreouer if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation ſhould be cauſed of humour, to whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we attribute it? to the naturall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or to the excrement? the excrement is far remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart, &amp; is not ſo ready to affect it, a great diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce being betwixt their ſeueral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; &amp; in iau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, the gal ouerflowing the body, &amp; paſſing through the vaines, &amp; ſtaining all parts, we ſee them not ſo affected, more angry then at other times, or their bodies being cleered from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6813:57"/>the tincture of yellownes. If it be the naturall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, that is to ſay, the ſubtileſt part of the bloud, alwayes contained in the hart (whether you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that bloud which is comprehended in the two boſoms, or that wherwith the hart is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained &amp; nouriſhed in euery part) why is not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart alwayes affected without intermiſſion, with ſuch paſſions as the bloud enclineth vnto, ſeeing it is alwayes preſent, &amp; keepeth his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition alike? If you will haue it of neither, but of that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the great vain, ruſhing with violence into the right ſide of the hart, the quality of that bloud being of cooler temper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the heart hath already embraced, ſhould ſerue to mitigate the mood, rather then to adde mo ſtickes to the fire. To conclude this point, leſt I ſhould ſeeme to fight with a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: if either humor, or excrement ſhould haue part in mouing affections, no counſel of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, nor precept of wiſe men were comparable to calme theſe raging paſſions, vnto the purging potions of Phiſitians, &amp; in this caſe the Ellebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans of Anticera; the Colocynthis of Spaine, and the Rhubarb of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria, aboue all the ſchools of Diuinitie or Philoſophy. The leſſe I labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe humors in the kinds of naturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, or ſuch as riſe vpon occaſion, becauſe I thinke the errour is ſone remoued, &amp; requireth no long reaſoning. The other ſort which moue vs without cauſe, or externall obiect, either to ſadnes, anger, feare, or ioy, becauſe they ſeeme altogither to be effects of humors, no other cauſe being apparent whereto to aſcribe them, I will

               <p>WE do ſee by experience certaine perſons which enioy all the comfortes of this life whatſoeuer wealth can procure, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer friendſhip offereth of kindnes, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſecurity may aſſure them: yet to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with heauines, and diſmaide with ſuch feare, as they can neither receiue conſolation, nor hope of aſſurance, notwithſtanding ther be neither matter of feare, or diſcontentment, nor yet cauſe of daunger, but contrarily of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and gratulation. This paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by any aduerſity preſent or imminent, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to melancholie the groſſeſt part of all the blood, either while it is yet contained in the vaines: or aboundeth in the ſplene, (ordained to purge the blood of that droſſe and ſetling of the humours) ſurcharged therwith for want of free uent, by reaſon of obſtruction, or any wayes elſe the paſſage being let of cleare auoydance. The rather it ſeemeth to be no leſſe, becauſe purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, opening of a vayne, diet, and other order of cure and medicine, as phiſick preſcribeth, haue bene meanes of chaunging this diſpoſition, and mitigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe ſorowes, and quieting of ſuch feares, as melancholie perſons haue fancied to themſelues, &amp; haue as it ſeemeth reſtored both wit and courage. Hitherto we haue bene led by reaſon of the obiection from humors, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6813:58"/>great power in them of affecting the minde. It was anſwered before generally, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was done in the body of any parte to be done organically, and that was applied ſpecially to certaine obiections before aunſwered: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth here, that the ſame be applyed alſo to our humours, which haue no other power to affect the minde, then to alter the ſtate of the inſtrumentes: which next to the minde, &amp; ſoule it ſelfe are the only cauſes of all direct action in the body. So here we are to conſider, in what ſort the humours moue theſe perturbations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned: whether as cheefe workers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, or other kinde of helpers: and ſo how they may claime any intereſt in terrifying, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting the minde, this way or that way, as the obiections before mentioned would beare vs in hand. It hath ben declared before how the mind is the ſole mouer in the body, and how the reſt of the partes fare as inſtrumentes, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: whereby in naturall affections the humors are ſecluded from cheefe doers, and being no organicall partes ſerue for no inſtrumentes. For whatſoeuer hath any conſtant and firme action in our bodies, the ſtate of health remayning firme, is done either by ſoule, or by the partes of the body: of which the humours are neither, and ſo vtterly ſecluded of nature from any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any vſe of the body. For that they are ſaid to nouriſh, it ſignifieth only a paſſiue diſpoſition, by which through our nouriſhing power, they receiue the Character of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are altered into the ſubſtance of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6813:59"/>ſame, they themſelues giuing ouer their priuate actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſubmitting to the naturall concoctiue vertue, which deſtroyeth all particularities of nouriſhment, and bringeth them to that vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which our nature requireth. Then while the body is in health, the humors beare no ſway of priuate action, but it being once altered, and they euill diſpoſed, and breaking from that regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereunto they ſhould be ſubiect, are ſo farre of from ſubiection to the diſpoſition of our bodies, and ſtrength of our partes, that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, and as it appeareth in ſimptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call euentes in ſicknes, diſpiſe that gouernment, wherto by natures law they ſtand bound. Thus then I hold humours to be occaſions of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perturbations, euen as they are meanes of deprauing the inſtrument of perturbation, and turning it otherwiſe, then nature hath diſpoſed, whoſe gouernment when it hath ſhaken of, it affecteth vs two maner of wayes: the one by the corporall ſubſtance, whereby it annoyeth the corporall maſſe of bodies, and complexion, and breaketh out into ſoares, Empoſthumes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch anoyances: the other by a ſpirit which it poſſeſſeth, either contrary altogether, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe at the leaſt from ours, wherewith many wayes it diſturbeth the orderly actions, &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the vigor of the ſame: now both by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and by ſpirite it altereth complexion where it preuaileth, and thereby giueth greateſt ſtroake to the organicall members. Then ſeing all actions are performed both by ſpirite and corporall inſtrument, and the humours excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6813:59"/>the gouernment of nature, and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues from ſubiection thereof, affect vs both wayes, ſpirite againſt ſpirite, and corporall ſubſtance againſt his like, we are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, how by theſe two meanes our actions ſuffer through their diſorder, and where their operation taketh moſt place in working ſuch phantaſtical pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations wherewith we are deluded. Of all partes of the body, in ech perturbation, two are cheifly affected: firſt the brayne, that both apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the offenſiue or pleaſaunt obiect, &amp; iudgeth of the ſame in like ſort, and communicateth it with the harte, which is the ſecond part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: theſe being troubled carie with them all the reſt of the partes into a ſimpathy, they of all the reſt being in reſpect of affection of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The humours then to worke theſe effectes, which approch nigh to naturall pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations grounded vpon iuſt occaſion, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, alter either brayne or hart: if the brayne be altered, and the obiect not rightly apprehended then is it deliuered otherwiſe then it ſtandeth in nature, and ſo the hart moued to a diſorderly paſſion. Againe though the brayne be without faulte, and report delyuered to the hart ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: yet that being diſtempered, or altered in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion by faulte of humour, doth not aunſwere in affection as the obiect requireth: but more or leſſe, as the diſtemper miſleadeth: if both partes be ouercharged of humour, the apprehenſion &amp; affection both are corrupted, and miſſe of their right action, and ſo all thinges miſtaken, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that confuſed ſpirite, and thoſe ſtormes of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6813:60"/>outragious loue, hatred, hope or feare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bodies ſo paſſionate are here and there, toſſed with diſquiet. Now particularly the ſpirite of the humour being ſubtiler, thinner, and hoter then is meete, maketh the apprehenſion quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then it ſhould be, and the diſcretion more haſty, then is meete for the vpright deliuery to the hart, what to embrace or to refuſe: this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth pronenes to anger, when we are offended without cauſe, commonly called teaſtines, and frowardnes. If the humour alſo with his ſpirite poſſeſſe the brayne, then are theſe paſſions of longer continuance: humour being of a more ſollid nature then the ſpirite, and ſo not eaſily diſperſed, which cauſeth fittes of ſuch paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be of longer continuance: and thus the hart may be abuſed from the brayne: not much vnlike as it falleth often out in communication of ſpeach amongeſt vs: a man of haſty diſpoſition, ready to aunſwere, and quick witted, will make reply to that which ſhould be ſaid, before the tale be halfe told, whereby he faileth in his replication, and aunſwereth from the purpoſe: which if he had bene firſt aſſured, wherto to reply, he ſhould not haue miſſed. This appeareth plaine in Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke perſons, or ſuch as are diſpoſed to anger: ſuch are offended where they haue no cauſe in truth, but by miſtaking: and where they haue cauſe the vehemency of the apprehenſion, and the ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of the report from the brayne vnto the ſeate of perturbation, inforceth double the paſſion: eſpecially when the hart is as flexible, as the brayne is light: then raungeth it into all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6813:60"/>extremity. This commeth to paſſe, not by any power of anger in the Cholerick humour: but by reaſon the inſtrumentes are miſordered, either by vapour riſing from that humour, or the very ſubſtance of the ſame. They are diſordered in this ſort through Choler. The naturall ſpirit and complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe partes become ſubtiler, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and quicker, proner to action, then of their natures they ſhould be, through the heat which riſeth of Choler, and his ſpirit intermixed with ours: by this mobility of vapour, our ſpirit (of a quieter and more ſtable diſpoſition,) is either made more rare, then is expedient for the vſe of our bodies, or elſe ſtriuing as it were to ſubdue this baſtard ſpirite and vnwelcome gheſt, can not giue that attendance vpon his proper due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which naturally it ſhould: and ſo the actions thereupon riſe depraued, and hauing wherwith it is encumbred within, admitteth the cauſe of diſpleaſure more eaſily which riſeth abroad: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that which moleſteth at home: and theſe natures for the moſt parte are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Cholerick humour, or fretting, like to Choler, about the mouth of the ſtomach, which is of all the inward partes of quickeſt ſenſe and feeling. This cauſeth them, eſpecially faſting, before the humour be mitigated, and delayed with nouriſhment, to be moſt prone to that angry paſſion. The teaſty waywardnes of ſick perſons, ſuch as are vexed with payne or feauer, wherby the humors of the body become more fell maketh euident proofe hereof. We ſee how ſmall matters put them out of patience, &amp;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6813:61"/>euery thing offendeth: whereas in health the ſame occaſions would litle, or nothing moue. The reaſon is becauſe, they meaſure all outward accidents, by that they finde of diſcontentment within: not that the humor that diſcontenteth is any inſtrument of paſſion, or carieth with it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be diſpleaſed: but becauſe it diſquieteth the body, and giueth diſcontentment to nature, it is occaſion why diſpleaſures are made great: and where there is no cauſe, nature troubled within, faireth as greatly diſpleaſed with that which outwardly ſhould not diſpleaſe: the griefe within, being added to an indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and drawing it into like felowſhip of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, euen but for that it pleaſeth not: like as in a troubled ſea, a great veſſell is more eaſily ſtirred with ſmal ſtrength, then in the calme hauen, or quiet ſtreame: ſo our ſpirites, and organicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of paſſion, the parte toſſed with ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my weather of internall diſcontentment, is with litle occaſion diſquieted, yea with the ſhaking of a ruſh, that hath no ſhow of calming thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall ſtormes, that ariſe more troubleſome, and boiſterous to our nature, then all the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering windes in the Ocean ſea. For when our paſſion is once vp by ſuch occaſion, the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſenſe is alſo caried therewith, and diſtinction of outward thinges hindered at the leaſt, if not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, all things being wayed by that which nature findeth offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at within: euen as the taſt altered in feauers by cholerick vapours, maketh ſweete thinges ſeeme bitter, and vnpleaſaunt, which of themſelues are moſt delectable to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6813:61"/>taſt, and would greatly ſatisfie the ſame partie, the bitter reliſh through that taint of choller once taken away. And in this ſort in my opinion ariſeth the diſorderly, &amp; vnruly paſſion of chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, both increaſed, where ſome occaſion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and procured by inward diſpoſition of the bodie and ſpirit, when there is no pretence, or ſhewe of cauſe. This is ſeene as plainly in mirth and ioye, which riſeth as well vpon inward har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of ſpirit, humour, and complexion, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon glad tidings, or externall benefite whereof we take reioycing. A bodie of ſanguine comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion (as commonly we call it, although comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion be another thing, then condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors) the ſpirits being in their iuſt temper in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of qualitie, and of ſuch plenty as nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, not mixed or defiled, by any ſtraunge ſpirit or vapor, the humours in quantity &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie rated in geometricall, and iuſt proportion, the ſubſtance alſo of the bodie, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo qualified by mixture of elementes, as all conſpire together in due proportion, breedeth an indifferencie to all paſſions. Nowe if bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and keepe his ſincerity, and the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue by it, and the ſpirits riſing from the ſame, a comfort in the ſenſible partes, without doubt then, as anger without cauſe externall, roſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inward diſpleaſure; ſo this ſpirit, theſe humours, and this temper, may moue an inward ioy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no externall obiect may be accompted as iuſt occaſion. This is the cauſe that maketh ſome men prone to ioy, and laughter at ſuch thinges, as other men are not drawne with into any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6813:62"/>and maketh them picke out, and ſeeke for cauſes of laughter, not onely to moue others to the like, but to expreſſe their mery paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which riſeth by the iudgement of our ſenſes imparted to the hart, not regarding whether the cauſe be inward or outward, that moueth, which taketh comfort thereat, as though the obiect were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. This eſpecially commeth to paſſe if the bloud be ſuch about the hart, as his pureneſſe &amp; ſincereneſſe with ſweetneſſe that carieth mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of temper doth ſo comfort, and mollifie it, that it eaſily, &amp; aptly enlargeth it ſelf: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch bloud or ſuch vapor that hath this tickling qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, cauſeth a delight conceiued in the braine; and communicated with the hart, procureth a comfortable gratulation, and inward ioy of that whereof nature taketh pleaſure. For as we haue ſights, taſtes, ſmelles, noyſes, pleaſant obiectes without vs, and on the contrary part, as manie odious, and hatefull, which do force our ſenſes: ſo haue we alſo all theſe internall, pleaſaunt or vnpleaſaunt: &amp; as we haue of ſenſuall obiects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, ſo in like manner pleaſure &amp; diſpleaſure is communicated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within of the braine to the heart, of ſuch things as we are not able directly to referre to this or that qualitie: as we ſee it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with taſts oftentimes: ſuch mixtures may be in ſauces, that ſomething may pleaſe vs we cannot expreſſe what, rayſed of the compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This chiefly falleth to our bodies, when that which giueth this occaſion carieth force of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and light ſpirits: as wine, and ſtrong drinke, and all aromaticall ſpices, which haue a power
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6813:62"/>to comfort the braine, and hart, and affect all our bodie throughout with celeritie and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before their ſpirits be ſpent in the paſſage: then the braine giueth merie report, &amp; the hart glad for it ſelfe, and all the fellow members, as it were, daunceth for ioy, and good liking, which it receaueth of ſuch internall prouocations. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſee wine giue occaſion of mirth by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit, wherewith our ſpirit is delighted, and greatly increaſed, if it be drunke with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; ſo ſuch as are of merie diſpoſitions, enioy a naturall wine in their bodies, eſpecially harts &amp; braines, which cauſeth them to laugh at the wagging of a feather, and without iuſt matter of laughter, without modeſt regard of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance, to beare them ſelues light &amp; ridiculous: &amp; this my friende <hi>M.</hi> I take to be the cauſe of merrie greekes, who ſeeke rather to diſcharge them ſelues of the iocond affection, ſtirred vp by their humour, then require true outward occaſion of ſolace and recreation. Nowe as before I haue ſayd that choler procureth anger, not as cauſe, but as occaſion, ſo likewiſe bloud thus tempered and repleniſhed with theſe aromaticall and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſpirits, giueth occaſion only of this pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and is no cauſe thereof, the hart making iuſt claime to theſe affections as the only inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; vnder the ſoule, chiefe author of theſe vnruly companions: which inſtrument is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that obeying the mind, and thoſe naturall rules whereby all things are eſteemed, good or bad, true or falſe, to be done or not to be done, no otherwiſe then by a ciuill ſubiection ruled by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6813:63"/>counſell &amp; no conſtraint, it repugneth oft times all the ſtrong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions whatſoeuer reaſon can make to the contrary. Thus you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how a man may be angrie and merie without exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obiect, or outward cauſe: now let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, howe ſadneſſe and feare, the points which moſt belong to this diſcourſe, and your preſent ſtate, may alſo ariſe without occaſion of outward terror either preſently moleſting, or fearing vs by likelihood, or poſſibility of future danger. As the nature of choler is ſubtile, hote, bitter, and of a fretting and biting qualitie, both it ſelfe and the vapors that paſſe from it, and bloud tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſweet, and full of cheerefull and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirits, anſwerable to thoſe we haue ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, eſpecially if they become aromaticall, as I may terme them, and of a fragrant nature, by naturall temper, or by meanes of diet: ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie of qualitie, groſſe, dull, and of fewe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſpirits; and plentifully repleniſhed with ſuch as darken all the clerneſſe of thoſe ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and ingroſſe their ſubtilneſſe, defile their pureneſſe with the fogge of that ſlime, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſubſtance, and ſhut vp the hart as it were in a dungeon of obſcurity, cauſeth manie fearefull fancies, by abuſing the braine with vglie illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp; locketh vp the gates of the hart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirits ſhould breake forth vpon iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to the comfort of all the family of their fellowe members: whereby we are in heauineſſe, ſit comfortleſſe, feare, diſtruſt, doubt, diſpaire, and lament, when no cauſe requireth it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a behauiour beſeeminge a heart vppon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6813:63"/>iuſt cauſe, and ſound reaſon moſt comfortable, and chearfull. This doth melancholie work, not otherwiſe then the former humours, giuing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and falſe matter of theſe paſſions, and not by any diſpoſition as of inſtrument thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Of all the other humours melancholie is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of varietie of paſſion, both according to the diuerſitie of place where it ſetleth, as brayne, ſplene, meſaraicke vaines, hart, womb, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; as alſo through the diuerſe kindes, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, vnnaturall: naturall, either of the ſplene, or of the vaines, faultie only by exceſſe of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, or thickneſſe of ſubſtance: vnnaturall by corruption, and that either of bloud aduſt, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or melancholie naturall, by exceſſiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of heate, turned in compariſon of the naturall, into a ſharpe lye by force of aduſtion. Theſe diuerſe ſorts hauing diuerſe matter, cauſe mo ſtraunge ſymptomes of fancie and affection to melancholike perſons, then their humour to ſuch as are ſanguine, cholericke, or flegmaticke: which fleume of all the reſt ſerueth leaſt to ſtir vp any affection: but breeding rather a kind of ſtupiditie, and an impaſſionate hart, then eaſily moued to embrace or refuſe, to ſorowe or ioye, anger or contentedneſſe: except it be a ſalte fleume, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> approcheth it to the natur of choler, &amp; in like ſort therof riſeth anger &amp; frowardnes.</p>

               <p>NOw let vs conſider what paſſions they are that melancholy driueth vs vnto, and the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6813:64"/>reaſon how it doth ſo diuerſly diſtract thoſe that are oppreſſed therewith. The perturbations of melancholy are for the moſt parte, ſadde and fearefull, and ſuch as riſe of them: as diſtruſt, doubt, diffidence, or diſpaire, ſometimes furious, and ſometimes merry in apparaunce, through a kinde of Sardonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and falſe laughter, as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, is diſpoſed that procureth theſe diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thoſe which are ſad and penſiue, riſe of that melancholick humour, which is the groſſeſt part of the blood, whether it be iuice or excrement, not paſſing the naturall temper in heat whereof it partaketh, and is called cold in compariſon onely. This for the moſt part is ſetled in the ſpleane, and with his vapours anoyeth the harte and paſſing vp to the brayne, counterfetteth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible obiectes to the fantaſie, and polluting both the ſubſtance, and ſpirits of the brayne, cauſeth it without externall occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to forge monſtrous fictions, and terrible to the conceite, which the iudgement taking as they are preſented by the diſordered inſtrument, deliuer ouer to the hart, which hath no iudgement of diſcretion in it ſelf, but giuing credite to the miſtaken report of the braine, breaketh out into that inordinate paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt reaſon. This commeth to paſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inſtrument of diſcretion is depraued by theſe melancholick ſpirites, and a darknes &amp; cloudes of melancholievapours riſing from that pudle of the ſplene obſcure the clearenes, which our ſpirites are endued with, and is requiſite to the due diſcretion of outward obiectes. This at the firſt is not ſo extreame, neither doth it ſhew
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6813:64"/>ſo apparauntly, as in proceſſe of time, when the ſubſtance of the brayne hath plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunke of that ſpleneticke fogge, whereby his nature is become of the ſame quality, and the pure and bright ſpirites ſo defiled, and eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that their indifferency alike to all ſenſible thinges, is now drawen to a partiality, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as by melancholy they are inforced. For where that naturall and internall light is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their fanſies ariſe vayne, falſe, and voide of ground euen as in the externall ſenſible darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, a falſe illuſion will appeare vnto our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the light being brought in is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be an abuſe of fancie: now the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall darknes affecting more nigh by our nature, then the outward, is cauſe of greater feares, and more moleſteth vs with terror, then that which taketh from vs the ſight of ſenſible thinges: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ariſing not of abſence of light only, but by a preſence of a ſubſtantiall obſcurity, which is poſſeſſed with an actuall power of operation: this taking hold of the brayne by proceſſe of time giueth it an habite of depraued conceite, whereby it fancieth not according to truth: but as the nature of that humour leadeth it, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaſtely and fearefull. This cauſeth not only phantaſticall apparitions wrought hy apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only of common ſenſe, but fantaſie, an other parte of internall ſenſe compoundeth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth diſguiſed ſhapes, which giue great terror vnto the heart, and cauſe it with the liuely ſpirit to hide it ſelfe as well as it can, by contraction in all partes, from thoſe counterfet goblins, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6813:65"/>the brayne diſpoſſeſſed of right diſcerning, fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto the heart. Neither only is common ſenſe, and fantaſie thus ouertaken with deluſion, but memory alſo receiueth a wound therewith: which diſableth it both to keepe in memory, and to record thoſe thinges, whereof it tooke ſome cuſtody before this paſſion, and after, therewith are defaced. For as the common ſenſe and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, which doe offer vnto the memory to lay vp, deliuer but fables in ſtead of true report, and thoſe tragicall that diſmay all the ſenſible frame of our bodies, ſo eyther is the memory wholly diſtract by importunity of thoſe doubtes and feares, that it neglecteth the cuſtody of other ſtore: or elſe it recordeth and apprehendeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as by this importunity is thruſt therupon nothing but darkenes, perill, doubt, frightes, and whatſoeuer the harte of man moſt doth abhor. And theſe the ſenſes do ſo melancholikely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the mindes conſideration (which iudging of ſuch thinges as they offered, not hauing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do in the deeper examination) that it ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plyeth thoſe certayne ingenerate pointes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and wiſedome to a deceitfull caſe, though it be alwayes in the generall, and if particularities be deliuered vp a right, in them alſo moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and aſſured. For thoſe thinges which are ſenſible, and are as it were the counterfettes of ourward creatures, the reporte of them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Gods ordinaunce to the inſtruments of the brayne furniſhed with his ſpirite, which if it be, as the thinges are in nature, ſo doth the minde iudge and determine, no farther ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6813:65"/>it ſelfe to examine the credite of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which (the inſtrumentes being faultles, and certaine other conſiderations required neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, agreeable vnto their integrity,) neuer faile in their buſines, but are the very firſt groundes of all this corporall action of life and wiſedome, that the minde for the moſt parte here outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſeth. If they be contrary, ſo alſo doth the minde iudge, and purſueth or ſhuneth, for theſe ſenſible matters repoſing truſt in the corporall miniſters, whoſe miſereport, no more ought to diſcredite the minde, or draw it into an acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crime of error, then the iudiciall ſentence is to be blamed, which pronounceth vpon the oth and credite of a iurie impanelled of ſuch as are reported men of honeſty, credite, and diſcretion though their verdict be not peraduenture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the cauſe committed to them doth require. The memory being thus fraight with perills paſt: and embracing only through the braynes diſorder that which is of diſcomforte, cauſeth the fantaſie out of ſuch recordes, to forge new matters of ſadnes and feare, whereof no occaſion was at any time before, nor like to be giuen hereafter: to theſe fanſies the hart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering with like melancholicke affection, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all hope into feare, aſſurance into diſtruſt and diſpaire, ioye into diſcomforte: and as the melancholie nature, or bodie any waie corrupt, defileth the pure and holeſome nouriſhment, &amp; conuerteth it into the ſame kinde of impuritie: and as the fire of all kinde of matter giueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of heate, whether it be wood, ſtone, metal,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6813:66"/>or liquor: ſo the body thus poſſeſſed with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chearefull, and diſcomfortable darknes of mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, obſcureth the Sonne and Moone, and all the comfortable planetts of our natures, in ſuch ſort, that if they appeare, they appeare all darke, and more then halfe eclipſed of this miſt of blackenes, riſing from that hidious lake: and in all thinges comfortable, either curiouſly pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, and ſnatcheth at whatſoeuer of miſlike may be drawen to the nouriſhment of it ſelfe: or elſe neglecteth altogether that which is of other qualitie, then foode, and paſture of thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which nature neuer bred, nor perfect ſince conceiued, nor memorie vncorrupt would euer allow entertainement, but are hatched out of this muddie humour, by an vnnaturall temper &amp; baſtard ſpirite, to the diſorder of the whole regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane nature, both in iudgement and affection. Thus the hart a while being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with nothing elſe, but domeſtical terror, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euery thing, and the brayne ſimpathetically partaking with the hartes feare, maketh doubt, diſtruſteth, &amp; ſuſpecteth without cauſe, alwayes ſtanding in awe of grieuaunce: wher with in time it be commeth ſo tender, that the leaſt touch, as it were ones naile in an vlcer, giueth diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereto, rubbing it vpon the gale exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with ſorow and feare: neither only doubleth it ſorrow vpon ſmal occaſion, but taketh it where none is offered: euen as the Cholerick man fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ridiculous cauſes of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For firſt (the generall being in al natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions before the particular) the heart by the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6813:66"/>braine ſolicited to paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vſed to grief &amp; feare, taketh the accuſtomed way of flight and auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, abhorring &amp; fearing thoſe thinges, which of themſelues are moſt amiable and gratefull: at the firſt not being a duiſed, whereto to apply the paſſion: euen as one condemned to death with vndoubted expectation of execution, fearing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie knock at the priſon doore, hath horrour, though the meſſenger of pardon with knock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be admitted &amp; let in, and euery meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where daunger is feared, though he come with cherefull countenance, giueth cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt when there may be aſſurance: euen ſo, the heart ouercome with inward heauines, and ska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with inward feares, faireth as though what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer cauſe of affection and perturbation were miniſter of preſent griefe, or meſſenger of future daunger, by miſtaking only, and withdraweth it ſelfe, and ſhroudeth it as ſecrete and cloſſe, as nature will ſuffer, from that, which if cuſtome had not bent it another way, vppon aduiſement (now baniſhed through ſwiftnes and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of paſſion) it would haue with ioyful cheare em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſe in outward ſenſe: the ey, or the eare long and vehemently affected with colour, or ſound, or the noſe with ſtrong ſent: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the verie colour, ſound, and ſent in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, though the thing be remoued that yeelded ſuch qualities; ſo the internall ſenſes moleſted continually with this fearefull obiect of internall darknes, eſteemeth euery thing of that nature: the true qualitie thereof being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, by that which hath taken poſſeſſion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:6813:67"/>before. The brayne thus affected, and the heart anſwering his paſſion thereafter driueth vs into thoſe extremities of heauy moode, which aſſaile and diſpoſſeſſe of right vſe of reaſon thoſe who are melancholickly diſpoſed: much more if the heart be as melancholickly bent, as the brayne: then diuerſe times doth it preuent the fancie with feare, and as a man tranſported with paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vtterly bereft of aduiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, cauſeth the ſenſes both outward &amp; inward prepoſterouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, as the heart vainely feareth. This melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly as the parts are diuerſe, &amp; actions vary, ſo doth it as it is ſeated, or paſſeth this or that way, breed diuerſity of paſſion: as in the heart a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in the ſtomach a greedy appetite: in the brayne falſe illuſions, and in the other partes as they are diſpoſed: ſo deprauing their actions, it cauſeth much variety of effects, which are not in the nature of the humor, but as it diſturbeth the actiue inſtrumentes, no more then darknes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome to ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, other ſome to go out of their way, &amp; wander, &amp; other ſome to bringe to paſſe ſuch purpoſes, as light would bewray &amp; hinder, alas they be diſpoſed &amp; occupied w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their buſines in the dark, &amp; not through any ſuch effectuall operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of darkenes, which is naught elſe but meere abſence of light.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie through diuerſity of parts only: but as the cuſtome of life hath bene before, &amp; the fancie, &amp; heart ſome way vehemently occupied: there through this humour all the faculties afore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are carried the ſame way, as it were with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6813:67"/>the ſtreame of a tide, driuen with a boyſterous wind; which cauſeth that melancholicke men, are not all of one nature paſſionate this way: the one taking his dolorous paſſion from his loue, another from his wealth: the other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, whereof his melancholie beareth him in hand the preſent loſſe, or imminent daunger of that wherein affection in former times had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt footing: &amp; on the other part, which before a man moſt abhorred, that nowe that humor vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with moſt vehemencie. Againe as it is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with other humours, either keeping medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, or abounding; ſo likewiſe breaketh it forth into ſuch diuerſities, &amp; manie times into plaine contrarieties of conceit and perturbation. Thus you vnderſtand, howe feares and ſorowes riſe, without cauſe from naturall melancholie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be iuyce, or excrement, not through chiefe action, as from worke of facultie, but by abuſe of inſtrument through occaſion. If the ſpleneticke excrement ſurcharge the bodie, not being purged by helpe of the ſplene: then are theſe perturbations farre more outragious, and harde to be mitigated by counſell or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and more do they enforce vs, the partes being altered with corporall humour, then with ſpirituall vapour: and ſo are the paſſions lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in continuance, and more extreeme in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie. For as the flame carrieth not ſuch force of burning as the cole, neither contayneth the heate ſo longe; euen ſo the partes affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the humour, which carrieth both groſſeneſſe of ſubſtance, with continuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6813:68"/>of that dimme vapour, ſettleth a more fixed paſſion of feare and heauineſſe, then that which riſeth from the vapour onely, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the owne accorde more eaſily vaniſhing and partly with greater facillitie waſted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtrife and reſiſtance. Nowe it followeth to declare, howe the other vnnaturall melancholy annoyeth with paſſions, &amp; abuſeth vs with cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet cauſe of perturbation, whereof there is no ground in truth, but onely a vaine and fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conceit.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEſides the former kindes, there are ſortes of vnnaturall melancholie: which I call ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the other, bicauſe the other offendeth onely in qualitie, or quantitie: theſe are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature farre diſagreeing from the other, &amp; by an vnproper ſpeech called melancholy. They riſe of the naturall humors, or their excrements by exceſſiue diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per of heate, burned as it were into aſhes in compariſon of humour, by which the humour of like nature being mixed, turneth it into a ſharp lye: ſanguine, cholericke, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke, according to the humour thus bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which we call by name of melancholie. This ſort raiſeth the greateſt tempeſt of perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and moſt of all deſtroyeth the braine with all his faculties, and diſpoſition of action, and maketh both it, &amp; the hart cheere more vncomfortably:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6813:68"/>and if it riſe of the naturall melancholy, beyond all likelihood of truth, frame monſt ous terrors of feare and heauineſſe without cauſe. If it riſe of choler, then rage playeth her part, and furie ioyned with madneſſe, putteth all out of frame. If bloud miniſter matter to this fire, euery ſerious thing for a time, is turned into a ieſt, &amp; tragedies into comedies, and lamentation into gigges and daunces: thus the paſſion whereof the humour min ſtreth occaſion, by this vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heate aduaunceth it ſelfe into greater extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. For becomming more ſubtile by heate, both in ſubſtance, &amp; ſpirit, it paſſeth more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into all the parts of the inſtrument it ſelfe, and is a conueyance alſo to the humour of the ſame kind: making away for naturall melancholie, wherewith it is mixed, into the verie inward ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of thoſe inſtruments, wherof paſſions are affected, euen hart and braine. Thus affected, you haue men, when deſperate furie is ioyned with feare: which ſo terrifieth, that to auoid the terrour, they attempt ſometimes to depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues of life: ſo irkſome it is vnto them through theſe tragicall conceits, although waighing and conſidering death by it ſelf without compariſon, and force of the paſſion, none more feare it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they. Theſe moſt ſeeke to auoyde the ſociety of men, and betake them to wilderneſſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, finding matter of feare in euery thing they behold, and beſt at eaſe, when alone they may digeſt theſe fancies without new prouocations, which they apprehende in humane ſocietie. If choller haue yeelded matter to this ſharpe kind
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6813:69"/>of melnncholie, then rage, reuenge, and furie, poſſeſſe both hart and head, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is caried with that ſtorme, contrarie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of reaſon: which hath no farther power ouer theſe affections, then by way of counſell to giue other direction (whereof the hart it ſelfe is deſtitute) and taking theſe diſcomfortes of the credit of the ſenſes, according thereto it appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe, working, and diſpoſing the ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wiſedome it is indued with, vnto theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which the corporall inſtruments cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly offer vnto it: which miniſtreth doubt and queſtion to ſome not well aduiſed in this point, whether reaſon it ſelfe be not impaired by theſe corporall alterations, and the immortall &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible mind hereby ſuffreth not viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; which is farre otherwiſe, if we duly way the matter. For the mad man, of what kinde ſoeuer he be of, as truly concludeth of that which fantaſie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth of conceit, as the wiſeſt: onely therein lieth the abuſe and defect, that the organicall parts which are ordained embaſſadours, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vnto the mind in theſe caſes, falſifie the report, and deliuer corrupt recordes. This is to be helped, as it ſhall be declared more at large hereafter, by counſell only ſincerely miniſtred, which is free from the corruptions of thoſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and deliuereth truth vnto the mind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it putteth in practiſe contrary to theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate and furious ſollicitors. This furie is bred, becauſe choler thus aduſt, getteth a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter egerneſſe of qualitie, and moleſting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and toyling the ſpirits, ingendreth a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6813:69"/>greater inwarde diſquiet and diſcontentment, then cruder choler doth procure. The third ſort is of merie mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholie, which riſeth of the bloud ouer heated in ſuch ſort as I haue declared. Of all the reſt of humours, bloud is moſt temperat and mild of diſpoſition, and comforteth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as hath bene mentioned, whoſe ſubſtaunce receauing that burning heat, whereof riſeth the third kind of this vnnaturall melancholie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth it to be of a nature quicke and freſh, and indueth it with a ſpirite of a nature ſomewhat more itching, and as it were, of a tickling quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then bloud it ſelfe. For of it ſelfe being (if it be pure and perfect) nutſweete, or milkeſweete, by this heate becommeth firſt ſuger or hony ſweet, which hath more force of affecting, and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a more ſubtile and quicke ſpirit: afterward by operation of heate, this ſweetneſſe is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a mild ſaltneſſe, voyd of fretting, which tickling and itching in theſe melancholicke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, cauſe them rather to be giuen to a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abſurd meriment, then a ſound ioye of hart, and comfortable gladneſſe: which forceth them into laughter ſomtimes, that without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to the tyring and wearying of their bodies, no perſwaſion of reaſon is able to call them to more ſobrietie. We may ſee in boyling of milke, what ſweetneſſe is procured vnto it thereby: &amp; howe hony much boyled, becometh ſalt &amp; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſuch is the force of heat in bloud, that it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that milke ſweet taſt, into hony ſweet: and that into a gentle &amp; itching brackiſhnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the melancholicke bodies, being as it were
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6813:70"/>tickled, render from their fooliſh fantaſie, and falſe liking of the hart, many abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous geſtures and ſpeeches, and (as farre altered this way, as the melancholick on the other ſide) ſnatch at ſmal occaſions, or none at all ofttimes, of anſwering this fond humor in outward light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of geſture &amp; countenance. Thus you heare in what ſort the humoures ſeeme to affect the mind, euerie one ſingled and keeping apart from his other fellowe humours: which, as they be tempered with the other naturall, or compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together with one or twaine of the like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſortes of melancholie, make many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, and differences of melancholie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: as ſome more ſadde, the other ſome more merie, ſome quieter, &amp; other ſome more prone to rage and furie: and as the humors haue their courſes, as for the yeare, bloud in the ſpring, choller in ſommer, melancholie in autumne, &amp; fleume in winter: for the houre according to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus Epheſius opinion, bloud from three of the clocke in the morning, till nine of the ſame day, choler from nine of the morning, till three at af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noone, melancholie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 3. at after noone till nine at night, and fleume from nine at night til the third of the morning. I ſay if a man obſerue all theſe varieties, by mixture, and ſeaſon, with inclination of the partes, cuſtome of life, and imbecillitie of ſome part, and proportionallie match the multitude of paſſions with theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, he might haue the grounde of all theſe troubleſome perturbations made playne vnto him: why ſome are contrarie affected to other
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6813:70"/>ſome in their melancholicke fits, and are not all times alike, but ſometimes ſad, and ſometimes exceſſiue in mirth, now more outragious, then at another time, as ſeaſon of the yeare, and time of the day approach, wherein theſe humors haue more ſpeciall and perticuler operation. But it were too long to deſcend into ſuch particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: it ſhall ſuffice only, to haue declared howe theſe humors become occaſions of paſſions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and to haue noted ſuch a generalitie of rule, as any one may with eaſe thereby diſcipher the particulars. By that which hitherto hath bin ſhewed, it appeareth theſe humours only affect the organ and corporall part, &amp; nothing come nigh the mind and ſoule: which in the meane time of theſe ſtormes and tempeſts of paſſion, theſe deluſions, feares, falſe terrours, and poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call fictions of the braine, ſitteth quiet and ſtill, nothing altered in facultie, or any part of that diuine and impatible diſpoſition, which it obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the excellencie of creation: no more then the Sunne is moued in the heauens, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth in it ſelfe an obſcuritie, when ſtormes ariſe, thunder, lightning, and cloudes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and boyſterous whirlewindes, ſeeme here belowe to mixe heauen and earth together, and to make confuſion in the courſe and frame of nature. And thus haue you the obiections alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt that freedome of the ſoule from the inconueniences, aunſwered I truſt to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Diuerſe accidents followe theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which are to be ſhewed, both of fanſie, ſenſe, and affection, and alſo geſtures &amp; actions
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6813:71"/>of weeping, ſighing, ſobbing, laughing, &amp; ſuch like, with the reaſons of each one, and howe they be wrought by theſe paſſions: which I deferre in this place to diſcuſſe, being called on to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the aunſwer to the reſt of the doubts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded before: which done (that nothing, ſo farre as my vnderſtanding &amp; memorie will help to the matter, may be leaft obſcure vnto you in this caſe of melancholie) I will hereafter proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe alſo, as I ſhall haue done the cauſes from whence they proceede.</p>

The laſt of the obiections is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſicke perſons, who as in apparance it ſeemeth both receaue in their mindes altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of defect, and increaſe of faculties through the corporall imbecillitie: as though at certaine times the bodies health were tranſported to the

To which obiection, the general aunſwer of organicall diſpoſition of parts is here more particularly to be applied: &amp; as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doubtes, ſo in this I iudge all ſuch actions, as the mind ſeemeth to performe in that ſtate of bodie, better or worſe, to be organicall, perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſenſible things: &amp; which as it practiſeth not but in this life, neither hath ſuch vſe of being diſioyned from this maſſe of earth whereto it is with ſpirite coupled, ſo in her faculties ſhe is not to be eſteemed ſubiect to theſe alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But you demaund a farther declaration of this point, whether the minde hath vſe of ſenſe or not, after it diſlodgeth from this earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. To ſatisfie you herein, if probabilitie of reaſon will ſerue, I do not take it otherwiſe, then that it is all an eye, all an care, all noſe, taſt and ſinewe, without diſtinction, as theſe ſeuerall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments which nowe it employeth make ſhew of: For then were it not ſimple in ſubſtance, but muſt needs haue compounded ſubſtance, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe particular ſenſes. If you require ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and example of this, becauſe it cannot be had in ſoules departed (but reaſon onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the rule in reſpect of them) let vs take that which dreames in ſleep do miniſter for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this point, which ſleepe is a kind of ſeparation of the ſoule from the body for a time, at the leaſt a reſt from outward ſenſible actions, whereby it more freely applyeth it ſelfe to thoſe

If you will ſay it is nothing elſe, but the images of outward thinges, which hang in the common ſenſe preſented to the fantaſie, or offered of the memorie, which inward ſenſes are alwayes watchfull when the outward take reſt: how then commeth it to paſſe, that we can not in like ſort fancie being awake? If we ſhold ſtriue to do it, euery one ſhould find it impoſſible, as I take it: becauſe the ſoule is in a ſorte by that great law of neceſſitie (being chained with that golden chaine) in all parts linked to this bodie, which being awake, letteth thoſe ſincere actions whereabout it is buſied in ſleepe: wherein euery dreame ſeemeth to be a kind of extaſie, or traunce, &amp; ſeparation of the ſoule from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſocietie, in which it hath bene in olde time inſtructed of God by reuelation, and miſteries of ſecrets reuealed vnto it, as then more fit to apprehend ſuch diuine oracles, then altogether enioying awake the corporall ſocietie of theſe earthly members. But you will ſay ſuch dreames are oft times but fancies. True: and many times they be no fancies; whereof infinite examples
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6813:72"/>may be brought, both ſacred &amp; prophane. Now when they be not, ſufficient profe ariſeth to that I nowe diſpute, that ſoules haue ſenſe of thinges without organicall ſenſes: and when they be but fancies, yet that which miniſtreth the obiect, from ſome diſtemper of diet, or condition of the bodie, good or bad, is ſented with the mind on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the outward ſenſes being all in deepe ſleepe, and the inwarde hauing no power at all to ſee, heare, ſmell, taſt or feele, but only of diſcerning that which the outward ſenſe deliuereth: for third, there is none to whome theſe actions are to be aſcribed. Neither are theſe ſenſible actions of the minde to be accompted falſe: becauſe it ſeeth in dreames things paſt as preſent: for ſo it doth alſo future things ſometimes: which rather may argue, that both paſt, and to come are both preſent vnto the mind, of ſuch things as fall into the capacitie of her conſideration. If anie man thinke it much to aduance the mind ſo high, let him remember from whom it proceeded, &amp; the maner howe it was created, and the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent eſtate thereof before the fall, and no doubt it will ſufficiently aunſwer that difficultie, and confirme that which I haue ſaid. And thus much for that interruption of my aunſwer to the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from ſickneſſe: whether the ſoule hath outward ſenſe and not organicall, or no. Now to proſecute the aunſwere: I ſay all thoſe which ſeeme to be faculties altered in ſickneſſes, be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly organicall diſpoſitions which the ſoule vſeth as ſhe findeth them. As for the outward ſenſes, the humidities, and ſuperfluities of the eares in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6813:73"/>ſome ſickneſſe being dried vp, maketh hearing more quicke then in health: ſo the poores of ſmelling may be more open: and the eye by the ſame reaſon receaue quicker ſight: and the ſenſe of feeling more exact: or by reaſon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites are more ſubtile, which thereby with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe flowe into all partes of the inſtrument nowe emptied of ſuperfluity. Againe in phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke perſons, we ſee through drineſſe of the braine and ſinewes, what ſtrength they become of, that fower men in health are ſcarſe able to hold them, though otherwiſe weake and feeble Nowe the outward paſſages of ſenſes thus clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the ſpirits more rare and ſubtile, deliuer more exactly to the inwarde the Ideas of ſuch things as require to be admitted: which inward ſenſes by like diſpoſition of the braine, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly diſcerne the outward qualitie of thinges, &amp; deliuer more ſincere reporte vnto the minde, which finding all ſo cleare giueth ſentence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, and debateth more perfectly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that diſtinction and clearneſſe it findeth in thoſe perſonall repreſentations of thinges; which may ſeeme vnto ſuch as conſider not duely whereof it riſeth, to be an increaſe of gift in the minde by ſickeneſſe, and not greater cleareneſſe of the obiect. This diſpoſition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument cauſeth ſome children to be more pregnant then other ſome, and in ſickeneſſe manie one to be of better aduiſement then in health: and if you liſt inferre it vppon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer groundes; I will not denie this to be the cauſe whie ſome be idiottes and fooles, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6813:73"/>other ſome of quicke ſpirit, and prompt witted. Nowe as this clearing of the poores, and ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of ſpirits, is cauſe of theſe more readie and diſtinct actions in ſickneſſe then in health, and in youth aboue the tenderneſſe of yeares: ſo in health the poores repleniſhed with their humours, and the ſpirites recouering their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie groſſeneſſe, or mediocritie, the actions become of the ſame condition they were before: not by anie alteration of facultie, but through inſtrument diuerſly diſpoſed. In like manner the aged, farre ſtroken in yeares, faile in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of externall actions: though their mindes ſhould rather be wiſer through experience, (if anie thing be learned by the practiſe of this life) by excrementitious humiditie, and rew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke ſuperfluities, which drowne the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and an internal drineſſe, whereby all wayes to that ſmall re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nant of ſpirit is ſtopped, through contraction and ſhrinking of poores, the verie cundites of the ſpirit into all the corporal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: neither only do they faile in outward ſenſe and motion, but by the internall alſo ſuffer like imbecillitie, whereuppon their minde framinge concluſions vpon falſe groundes, ſeeme to faile in that action alſo, not hauing better matter to work on. If you ſay vnto me: why is not this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by that inorganicall ſenſe of the minde, and ſo theſe in conueniences auoyded? you muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the minde neuer exerciſeth that, but being withdrawen from the corporall ſocie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, &amp; theſe mechanicall actions, which in a maner in ſleepe &amp; extaſie it is: then it maketh choice of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6813:74"/>as it liſteth it ſelfe: what, who, where, and when: neither is it tied to theſe outward mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or thoſe Ideas which they take viewe of. Moreouer we muſt remember that during this life (ſauing vpon certaine occaſions extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,) God hath ordained theſe actions corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: neither is it neceſſary that wants of outward ſenſes ſhould be ſo ſupplied, which (before ſinne tooke ſuch hold of ſoule and body) were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to theſe imbecillities, but perfectly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deliuered the condition of ſenſible things to the mindes conſideration, which repoſing truſt in them, according to the integrity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they firſt ſtoode, diſchargeth her office of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, iudging, and willing, as this way only it findeth cauſe. And thus much touching the aunſwere to the former obiections: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whoſe probabilities to the contrary, you may perceiue how the body only receiueth theſe alterations before mentioned, euen as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a corporall ſubſtance, and raiſed from the earth, ſubiect to earthly and elementary chaunges, without touch of ſoule, or diſturbing of that immortal nature, which proceeded from the breath of God, and is of a more noble race: neither are you ſo to vnderſtand me, as though I accompted the ſoule in this preſent ſtate equall with the firſt creation: that were erronious and againſt the hiſtory of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fall, and of that curſe, which enſued through diſobedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that experience, which euery one fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of imbecillity in the moſt excellent actions of the minde, and ſuch as require no organ: but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6813:74"/>my diſcourſe tendeth in this point to exempt it from corporal contagion only, which it can not in any ſort receiue, more then the heauens pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from the earth, being a nature farre more different in compariſon then the heauens, from this inferiour world, which is alotted to our vſe, of habitation.

               <p>AS all other ſtate of bodie, ſo the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſheweth it ſelf, either in the qualities of the body, or in the deeds. Of the qualities which are firſt taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholick without aduſtion, is cold and drie: of ſuch as are
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6813:75"/>ſecond, riſing from the firſt, of colour blacke and ſwart, of ſubſtance inclyning to hardnes, leane, and ſpare of fleſh: which cauſeth hollownes of eye, and vnchearefulnes of countenance, all theſe more or leſſe, ſome or all: either as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly is ingenerate, or gotten by error of diet, hath continued longer, or ſhort time. Of deedes, and ſuch as are actions of the brayne, either of ſenſe and motions, dull, both in outward ſenſes, and conceite. Of memory reaſonable good, if fancies deface it not: firme in opinion, and hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly remoued wher it is reſolued: doubtfull before, and long in deliberation: ſuſpicious, painefull in ſtudie, and circumſpect, giuen to fearefull and terrible dreames: in affection ſad, &amp; full of feare hardly moued to anger, but keeping it long, and not eaſie to be reconciled: enuious, and ielous, apt to take occaſions in the worſe part, and out of meaſure paſſionate, whereto it is moued. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe two diſpoſitions of brayne and heart ariſe ſolitarines, morning, weeping, &amp; (if it be of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine aduſt) melancholie laughter, ſighing, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, lamentation, countenance demiſſe, and hanging downe, bluſhing and baſhfull, of pace ſlow, ſilent, negligent, refuſing the light and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of men, delighted more in ſolitarines &amp; obſcurity. Theſe are actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which lie in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to doe, and are called animall. Of naturall actions, their appetite is of greater then their concoction, digeſtion ſlow, and excretion not ſo ready, pulſe rare, and ſlow. And thus faireth it with melancholy perſons in thoſe deedes which are actions. Other deedes are certayne workes,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6813:75"/>and effectes of their naturall actions: ſuch are nutritiue iuice, or excrement. Their nutritiue iuice as blood, and the ſecondary humours that riſe there from, are thick and groſſe, their blood blacke, and nothing freſh. Their melancholicke excrement very much, if the ſplene do his part: if it faile, either by imbecillity of attraction, or any hinderance of obſtruction, then is it more plentifull in the vaynes, and greately altereth the complexion: if it diſcharge not itſelfe of the ſuperfluitie of that it hath drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blood, then ſwelleth it, and groweth it into obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cauſeth ſhortnes of breathing, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meate, and an vnnaturall boyling of heate, with wyndines vnder the left ſide, and plenty of humidity in the ſtomach, which aboundeth in ſpitting by hindering the firſt concoction in the ſtomach and noyſome vapours, cauſing palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart.

               <p>THE bodies of melancholike perſons, if they be naturally giuen to that humor, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe it hath preuailed in time vpon them, are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6813:76"/>colder, and dryer then others, or if they be ſuch by error of diet, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in times paſt they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues haue bene: partly through contagion of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which with his cold altereth the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and partly by the nouriſhment taken from the maſſe of blood: becauſe all the partes are maintayned, and releeued with cold and dry ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the reſt of the blood being cooled by that groſſe, and earthy parte. Sometimes it faireth with them otherwiſe, to be intemperately hote through obſtruction, which may gather heat in the ſplene, and ſo accidentally breed an hoate diſtemper. Againe if the melancholie be of the aduſt kinde, which pertaketh of heate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth eger and fell, then are they alſo diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in heate, or at the leaſt not moleſted with cold, and howſoeuer it faire with them in hoate or cold, alwayes they keepe drie in ſubſtance of their bodies, both the naturall, and the aduſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melancholy agreeing therewith. An humidity they haue of Rewme, and ſpitting from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, whoſe concoction is hindred, and natural heate cooled ſometimes by the ſplenes diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which lieth nigh thereunto, and may with more plenty then need requireth of that ſoure iuice, which ſerueth to ſtirre vp appetite, dull that heat of the ſtomach wherewith the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is made perfect, and excrementes become few: but this is a moiſtnes excrementitious, and accidentall in that parte, and peraduenture like in the brayne, by conſent of the ſtomach: the ſubſtance of the reſt keeping drie through the nature of the nouriſhment, which in time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6813:76"/>the complexion of like qualitie. They are not ſo well fleſht, nor in ſuch good plight, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue ben, or as ſome other complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: by reaſon all the natural actions, that ſhould ſerue that vſe, are become weaker, &amp; as it were ſmothered with this ſoote of melancholie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the melancholie blood cold and drie, a fitte matter to raiſe vp fatt, or plenty of fleſh: for to both theſe are requiſite a moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the firſt qualities, and a matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate temper, which may entertaine both fleſh and fat. Thirdly the poores of the body being not ſo free, for diſtribution of blood, by reaſon of their groſſe nouriſhment, and nature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor with which his coldnes and ſowernes, (for ſuch is the taſte of melancholie) cloſeth vp the poores, or ſtraightneth the paſſages, &amp; of it ſelfe alſo ſlow of mouing, the bodie can not be filled with that corpulency which falleth to other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. To the nouriſhment and good plight of the body, theſe three are neceſſiarie: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on temperat, matter moderat, and paſſage free: which all falling contrary in melancholick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hindereth them of that good liking, &amp; full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of body, which otherwiſe they might enioy. For if the complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be too hote then waſteth it, and therein riſeth the cholerick skreetnes: if it be too cold, then raiſeth it not ſufficiency of nouriſhment of meates, drinckes, &amp; whatſoeuer we vſe for ſuſtentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life: but leaueth it crude and maketh mo ſuperfluities. If it be drie, then drinketh it vp vnto the ſolide partes, that which ſhould baſte and line the body with, hauing not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6813:77"/>to ſpare. If moiſt, then in ſtead of firme ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the body is ouercharged with a counterfette kinde of fatte, and hydropical fogge, which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſhewe of good habite. If the matter be hoat or drie, it ſoone vaniſheth, or hath not that ſtore of nouriſhing iuice, to yeeld matter of fleſh and fatte, beſides the firme nouriſhment. If moyſt, then ſwelleth it the body: and as water enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a ſponge, ſo doth moiſt nouriſhment ſoake into the bodie, and beareth it out, as faſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance doth naturally fill, raiſed from temperate nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If cold, then both hath it ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of naturall iuice, and flow to be paſſed from parte to parte, it is not eaſily receiued into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member, where of corpulencie doth riſe. The paſſages being either narrow of themſelues, or hindered by ſtopping, diſtribution is likewiſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, very requiſite to the maintenance of good liking, and moderate habite of the body: which being ouerlarge giue entertainement and place to groſſenes, whether it be ſound, or in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Now theſe three falling out, cold, drie, thick and hard of paſſage, in melancholick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, procure that leane, and ſpare bodie of the melancholicke: except it be by former cuſtome of diet, or naturally otherwiſe, which the force of melancholy hath not yet ſo farre altered. Of this coldnes and drynes, riſeth hardnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the fleſh of melancholy perſons is: except the melancholy riſe of ſome diſorder of diet, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions, and hath not yet entred ſo farre vpon the complexion. Of colour they be black, according to the humour whereof they are nouriſhed, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6813:77"/>the skinne alwayes receauing the blacke vapors, which inſenſibly do paſſe from the inward parts, taketh die and ſtaine thereof: ſauing that in the beginning it may come to paſſe otherwiſe, the body white, and bloud blacke; nature for a time ſeruing her ſelfe of that which is pureſt, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the groſſeſt in the vaines, till for want of better, in the end it be faine to take of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke, which before it diſdained: then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it the colour, and faireneſſe is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to morphe, maketh euident the humour which gaue the die, &amp; hath obſcured the former beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And thus are the qualities of melancholie bodies altered by this groſſe, earthie and darke humour.</p>

               <p>TOuching actions which riſe from the brain, melancholie cauſeth dulneſſe of conceit, both by reaſon the ſubſtance of the braine in ſuch perſonnes is more groſſe, and their ſpirite not ſo prompt and ſubtile as is requiſit for readie vnderſtandinge. Againe almoſt all the ſenſes ſtanding in a kinde of paſſiue nature, a ſubſtance cold and drie, and by conſequent hard, is not ſo meete thereto; which as it ſerueth well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which is once ingrauen, ſo like ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant it keepeth, in compariſon of other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that which once it hath receaued: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as they are vnfit to commit readily to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſo retaine they that is committed in ſurer
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6813:78"/>cuſtodie. Sometime it falleth out, that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie men are found verie wittie, and quickly diſcerne: either becauſe the humour of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie with ſome heate is ſo made ſubtile, that as from the drieſt woode riſeth the cleareſt flame, and from the lyes of wine is diſtilled a ſtrong &amp; burning aqua vitae, in like fort their ſpirits, both from the drineſſe of the matter, and ſtraining of the groſſe ſubſtance from which they paſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing a pureneſſe, are inſtrumentes of ſuch ſharpneſſe: which is the drie light that Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus approued. To this, other reaſons may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: as exerciſe of their wittes, wherein they be indefatigable: which maketh them ſeeme to haue that of a naturall readineſſe, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of exerciſe, and vſe hath found in them. Moreouer, while their paſſions be not yet vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whereby they might be ouercaried, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly breedeth a ielouſie of doubt in that they take in deliberation, and cauſeth them to be the more exact &amp; curious in po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of things: to theſe reaſons may be added, the vehemencie of theyr affection once rayſed: which carieth them, with all their faculties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging, into the deapth of that they take pleaſure to intermeddle in. For though the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie man be not ſo eaſily affected with any other paſſion, as with thoſe of feare, ſadneſſe, &amp; ieloſie, yet being once throughly heat with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie paſſion, retaineth the feruency thereof farre longer time then anie other complexion: and more feruently boyleth therewith, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his heart and ſpirite hath more ſolliditie of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6813:78"/>ſubſtance to entertayne deepely the paſſion, which in a more rare and thinne ſooner vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away. Thus greedineſſe of deſire in thoſe thinges which they affect, maketh them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and painefull, warie and circumſpect, and ſo in actions of braine and ſenſe not inferiour to the beſt tempers; as alſo it maketh them ſtiffe in opinion. Their reſolution riſeth of long deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, becauſe of doubt and diſtruſt: which as it is not eaſily bred, ſo it is alſo harde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue. Such perſons are doubtfull, ſuſpitious, and thereby long in deliberation, becauſe thoſe domeſticall feares, or that internall obſcuritie, cauſeth an opinion of daunger in outwarde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, where there is no cauſe of doubt: their dreames are fearefull: partly by reaſon of their fancie waking, is moſt occupied about feares, and terrours, which retayneth the impreſſion in ſleepe, and partly through blacke and darke fumes of melancholie, riſing vp to the braine, whereof the fantaſie forgeth obiectes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth the ſleep of melancholy perſons.

               <p>TOVCHING their affections of feare and ſadneſſe, ſufficiently hath bene ſayd before; ſauing whether is firſt in place, and poſſeſſeth firſt the melancholicke heart, it may make ſome queſtion. In mine opinion, feare is the verie ground and roote of that ſorowe, which melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are throwne into. For a continuance of feare, which is of daunger to come, ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth the heart that it maketh it as nowe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is only in expectation; and although the daunger feared be abſent, yet the aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof in the opinion of a melancholicke braine is alwayes preſent, which ingendreth a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6813:79"/>ſorow alwayes accompanying their feares. They are hardely moued to anger, except a biting and fretting choler be mixed with their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, or the melancholy be of an aduſt kind: by reaſon they be ouer paſſion at another way, and haue their partes of groſſer ſenſe then eaſily to be offended, and the heart not ready to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, being of a colder and drier nature: or ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the humor, which being once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindled with that paſſion, retayneth the heate longer, and is not eaſily brought againe into the former temper. Enuious they are, becauſe of their owne falſe conceaued want, whereby their eſtate, ſeeminge in their owne fantaſie much worſe then it is, or then the condition of other men, maketh them deſire that they ſee other to enioy, to better their eſtate: this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them couetours of getting, though in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence where their humour moueth them with liking, or a voydance of perill, more then prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. Ielouſie pricketh them, becauſe they are not contented with any moderation, but thinke all too little for ſupply of their want: eſpecially if it ſtand in ſuch matters as import great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, or otherwiſe they doe earneſtly affect: and are in feare leaſt communication breede whole diſpoſſeſſion, or make inequall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They interprete readilie all to the worſe part, ſuſpitious leaſt it be a matter of farther feare, and not indifferently weighing the caſe, but poyſing it by their fantaſticall feare, and doubt at home. Paſſionate they be out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whereto a vehement obiect &amp; of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6813:80"/>vrgeth them: this cauſeth them to be amorous, both becauſe it is a pleaſure to loue, which mittigateth their inwarde ſorowe and timiditie, thinneth their bloud, and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the heart, and a cauſe to be beloued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which of all thinges liketh the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie perſonnes, being the greateſt meanes of comfort vnto them: from which all offices of kindeneſſe, curteſie, and grace do flowe: this affection riſeth not vnto them by pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature, but by the force of that which draweth them vnto the vehemencie of paſſion, wherein they ſo oft times exceede, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaueth them for a time (ielouſie excepted) of all other affection. If the melancholie be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine aduſt, then may it ſupply the want in the obiect, and cauſe an internall amorous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ſuch dotage, that maketh no diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the affection is beſtowed: as he that is of a merrie nature will laugh at his conceit, and the angrie man diſpleaſed with his owne ſhadowe. Thus farre of the ſimple actions of brayne and heart, which are altered in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke perſonnes, and the manner howe, with reaſon of their alteration: other actions are in compariſon of theſe mixed: as mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, riſing of vaine feare, or counterfet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, ſolitarineſſe, leaſt occaſion of griefe be miniſtred by companie and reſort: ſilence, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough retraction of ſpirits by their paſſion (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in mornfull plaintes) to mitigate the ſorowe, and ſtiffeneſſe of the inſtrumentes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſorderly feare and heauineſſe which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6813:80"/>cannot either miniſter, nor take occaſion of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar conference and communication, wholly tranſporting them to the concocting of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull humour: which breedeth in them (the paſſion more and more increaſing) a negligence in their affaires, and diſſoluteneſſe, where ſhould be diligence. Of pace, they are for the moſt part ſlowe, except perill cauſe them to haſten; both by reaſon of their members not ſo nimble for motion, and the mind occupied with cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtudie ſtayeth the pace: as we finde our ſelues affected, when any matter of weight entreth into our meditatation. Moreouer they are giuen to weeping ſometimes (if the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie be ſanguine, they exceed in laughter) ſighing, ſobbing, lamentation, countenance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, &amp; lowring, baſhfulneſſe, and bluſhing, the reaſons whereof and manner how they ariſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it requireth a larger diſcourſe, I will refer them more particularly to be diſcuſſed in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chapters followinge, with Philoſophicall cauſes, or probabilities (at the leaſt) how euerie one of theſe are wrought, that you be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in that ſpeculation of melancholie, and the accidents which followe it, as you are (more then I wiſh, or ſtandeth with your preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) exerciſed in the practiſe.</p>

               <p>OF all the actions of melancholie, or rather of heauineſſe and ſadneſſe, none is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifolde
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6813:81"/>and diuerſe in partes, as that of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Firſt of all it putteth finger in the eye, and ſheadeth teares: then it baſeth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce into the boſome: thirdlie it draweth the cheekes with a kinde of conuulſion on both ſides, and turneth the countenaunce into a reſemblaunce of girninge, and letteth the browes fall vppon the eye liddes; it bleareth the eyes, and maketh the cheekes redde: it cauſeth the heade to ake, the noſe to runne, &amp; mouth to ſlauer, the lippes to tremble: inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the ſpeeche, and ſhaketh the whole cheſt with ſighes, and ſobbes: and ſuch are the companions of this ſorowful geſture of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: of which I will deliuer you the reaſon one by one, firſt beginning with teares. All obiects, or cauſe of perturbation riſeth more or leſſe grieuous, or acceptable, as it is taken: and although the cauſe be greate, if it be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, it moueth no perturbation at all. This cauſeth ſome to ſorowe, whereat another reioyceth: and other ſome to lament, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome beare out with courage, or haue no ſuch ſenſe of: and to exceede in ioye or ſorowe, (except reaſon moderate the affection) where other ſome keepe mediocritie: by reaſon of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine degree of apprehenſion: yea though rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beare no part in the moderation. Moreouer ſeeing it is neceſſarie, that both braine and hart be diſpoſed in a kinde of Sympathie, to ſhewe foorth the affection, as they be diuerſlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſo may the cauſe of perturbation more or leſſe moue and trouble. As if the brayne be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6813:81"/>quicker of conceit, and of more exact diſeretion then the heart is ready to yeeld his paſſion, by reaſon of a more compact &amp; firme temper, then is it not aunſwerable to the apprehended hurte or daunger. If it be more dull, then by reaſon the apprehenſion entreth not duly into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the preſent ſtate, or imminent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, the affection aunſwereth not the cauſe. If the hart be more tender, then the braine ready: there is feare and heauineſſe oft times, either without cauſe, or more vehement then cauſe requireth: and thus it fareth in the reſt of the perturbations, theſe three alwayes concurring in the affection: the outwarde mouer or cauſe, the apprehenſion of the braine, and the motion of the hart: according to the varietie &amp; diuerſe diſpoſition of which three, the perturbations become diſtinct in kinde, and diuerſe in degree. This is neceſſarie for you to know, for the more playne deliuerie of the cauſes of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes before mentioned: and firſt of teares, whoſe paſſion is not euerie kinde of griefe, nor anie one kinde alike taken, neither though the griefe be taken alike, and the cauſe iuſt &amp; true, yet doeth the partie not alwayes ſheade teares, thus affected. Firſt therefore, for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of this matter of tears we are to ſearch what kinde of thing it is that moueth weeping, then how it is to be receiued to work this effect, and thirdly of what diſpoſition they are when iuſt occaſion is miniſtred, and the cauſe be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that readily ſignifie their inward paſſion, by that dolorous outward geſture and action. Of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6813:82"/>ſuch cauſes as draw vs into perturbatton &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion, that only which moueth griefe and ſorrow of hart cauſeth teares. Such weeping as ſeemeth to proceed of ioy is of a mixt cauſe as ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be declared, and maketh no exception to that vniuerſall cauſe ofteares procured by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or greeuance: for elſe we ſee no man weep but in ſorow: neither do any ſorow, but vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or perſwaſion of calamitie, or hurt, either preſent or to come: ſauing thoſe which are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholick paſſionate, who notwithſtanding fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnto themſelues a counterfet occaſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of without cauſe. This I need not ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it ſelfe, and requireth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other two being of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty, &amp; of more diligent conſideration. Touching the firſt of the two latter, how the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffection is moued for weeping, I take it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the paſſion be not very extreame, nor of the higheſt degree of ſorow, neither ſo light and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that the obiect be contemned. For the firſt: if the perturbation be too extreame, and as it were rauiſheth the conceite, and aſtonieth the heart, then teares being ordinary, and naturall to a kinde of mediocritie of that paſſion, are not affoorded to an extraordinary affection: euen as a ioy ſuddaine and rare taketh away for the preſent, the ſignification of reioycing, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the comforte which ſhould be receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an admiration, in ſteade of mirth and cheare: ſo in greate extremity offeare and heauines, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row being conuerted into an aſtoniſhment, the ſenſes rauiſhed, and the benu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med therewith, the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6813:82"/>teares are dryed vp or ſtayed, (being effectes of ordinary and of naturall paſſion,) and others more ſtraunger come in place, as voydaunce of vrine, &amp; ordure. For as cold in a kinde of degree, moueth ſenſe, and the ſame extreame becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and taketh it quite away: and as exceeding brightnes blindeth, or at the leaſt dazeleth the ſight aſwell as darknes obſcureth the obiect: ſo an occaſion of feare being beyond ordinary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of naturall paſſion, ſeemeth to the heart, &amp; vnderſtanding of another ſort, then whereat to ſorow, or teares belong, and the tokens of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie affection are due: which flow not, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (through that greate perturbation) nature is wholly violated, and keepeth no courſe of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed order: or becauſe ſuch is the flight of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from that which ſhe ſo abhorreth, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelf in her owne ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, ſhe draweth with her thoſe humidities, which eaſily follow with the ſpirites and blood, and are not ſeperable for vſuall excretion, beſides that contraction of her poores, whereby the effluxe of teares is hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: this in my opinion is the cauſe: why extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of terror or heauines refraineth teares, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if a fright haue gone before: which is of greateſt force to make this perturbation, and to ſhut vp the poores of our bodies. This appeareth in ſuch as are ſcarred: whoſe haire ſeemeth to ſtand vpright &amp; ſtiffe through that contraction. So then the ſame cauſe of paſſion in kind diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by degrees, both dolorous &amp; full of calamity nowe cauſeth abundance of weeping, &amp; guſheth out into brookes of teares, and anon dricth them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6813:83"/>al vp, through deſtruction of the minde, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditye as it were of the hearte: as though the cauſe of morning were altogether remoued. If you do require example in the ſelfe ſame perſon of weeping, and refraining from teares in the ſame kind of obiect, yet differing in degree, that is moſt ſinguler which is reported by Ariſtotle in the ſecond booke of his thetoricke, out of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus of Amaſis king of Aegypt. We are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with compaſſion only (ſayeth he) at the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction of ſuch familiars, as are not very nighly knitte vnto vs, either by acquaintance or affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and of the calamitie of diuerſe moſt deere friends or allies, we haue not compaſſion: but we are affected with their hurte, as with our owne: wherfore it is reported of Amaſis that although he did not weepe for his ſonne, whome he ſawe led to be put to death: yet at the calamitie of his friende Philippus, he ſhed teares: for that which in his friend was pityfull, ſhewed in his ſonne horrible, and terrible to behold: now terror, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, &amp; ſwalloweth vp alco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion. Which hiſtory of Amaſis, maketh cleere al doubt in this point, and confirmeth that which we propound by the reaſon of one of the moſt graueſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. As this ouer vehement feare dryeth vp theſe ſpringes of teares, or ſhutteth vp the paſſages that no way is giuen for them to diſtill: ſo the cauſe being light, and not greately vrging the heart, nature vſeth not to make ſuch ſhew of ſorow: ſo that at ſmall matters or ſo taken, no man vſeth to weepe. Children (for want of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) in a manner weepe at all occaſions
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6813:83"/>of offence alike: which tyme and age afterward correcteth. Thus then in my opinion the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be diſpoſed for weeping: euen in a meane, betwixt that light regard of perill or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie wherewith no man is moued to teares, and that vehement extremitie, which ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth amazednes and aſtoniſhment, wherewith nature either is benummed as it were, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled with the extremitie of paſſion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth her ordinarie ſignification of ſorow, in a caſe ſo farre extraordinarie: or elſe ſo farre withdraweth her ſelfe into the center of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with her ſpirite, blood, and humiditie, and cloſeth vp her poores ſo ſtraightly, that neither matter of teares is readie, nor paſſage free for them to diſtill by. For the naturall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſuch as depend not vpon voluntarie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening or ſhutting (as of the bladder, &amp; ſtoole) ſo farre only are open, as they be diſtended and filled with blood, humour, &amp; ſpirite: which being withdrawen as in a dead bodie, they cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like an empty bagge. But why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſay you) do ſome make vrine for feare: and why doth not nature withold it, aſwell as teares, being a kinde of excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not much vnlike? The reafon is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: ſuch retention as is performed by muſcle &amp; animall faculty, deſcending from the brayne by ſinues, is of another ſorte, then that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by aſtriction of poore: againe ſuch excrementes as are already congregated into a place of recept, from whence they are to be voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the body hereafter, are not of like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with that which hath as yet no ſeperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6813:84"/>For the firſt pointe: the bladder; as alſo the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, haue ech of them a certaine round muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which hath power of opening and cloſing within it ſelf: which opening, way is giuen to the excrement, that of it ſelfe (finding paſſage) iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the bodie: or without opening (and it be a liquid excrement as vrine is) if the muſcle ſhutt not cloſe, or retentiue feebled, it voydeth alſo, though not ſo plentifully as being full open. Now in feares that exceede, the ſpirites influent into that muſcle (as al are ſuch that pertaine to ſence and motion) are caled backe, as I haue before declared, to their proper fountaines, and ſo it being left deſtitute, receiueth a kinde of paraliticall diſpoſition for the time, and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in his office, which is the cauſe of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntary excretion. Now if you conſider &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how the vrine paſſeth from the kide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys by thoſe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g veſſels, you ſhall well perceiue there can be no refluxe backward, though it be forced. for they diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not directly, opening the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as a touch hole into a gune, but ſloplings betwixt the ſubſtance of the bladder, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſlender and thinne skinnes, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the entraunce of the humour cloſe vp, in ſuch ſort, as the fuller the bladder is, the firmer is their hold, as you may ſee in the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clacke of a paire of bellowes: experience hereof is made manifeſt in a bladder, which being blowen retaineth the aire and ſuffereth not to vent, though it haue enterances, ſuch as I haue ſpoken for the vrine. This then is one hinderaunce why the vrine can not be retracted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6813:84"/>the way being made vp by thoſe skinnes, &amp; the manner of the entraunce ſuch of that excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the bladder, why ſuch ſtopping can not be in them, as falleth out by cloſing of poores, that happeneth to other partes through euacuation for theſe paſſages are neither ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they be full: nor cloſſe, becauſe they be emptie, but are the one for the other, at our voluntary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: to this is the largenes of the paſſages to be added, which hinder the cloſe ſinking of all ſides together, whith the poſition of the body downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward direct: and thus much for the difference of the retention and excretion, and how by reaſon the partes containing the exerement no calling backe of humors can be, as in other parts which haue fluxe and refluxe free. Touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, this difference alſo is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that vuch humours as are not yet ſeperated for euacuation, follow the courſe of ſpirites, and ebbe and flow with them, being within the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature, which the vrine contained in his naturall vrinall, and attending the opening of the paſſage and deſtitute of thoſe actiue ſpirites can not doe: and this I take to be the cauſes, why in extreame paſſions of feare, vrine may paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his wil, that notwithſtanding can ſhed no teares by the ſame extremity. The third pointe remaineth, for the more eaſie declaration of this dolefull geſture, of what diſpoſition of body they are of, who are apt to teares. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt altogether of a moiſt, rare, and tender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, eſpecially of brayne and heart, which both being of that temper, carie the reſt of the parts
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6813:85"/>into like diſpoſition: this is the cauſe why chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are more apt to weepe, then thoſe that are of greater yeares, and women more then men, the one hauing by youth the body moiſt, rare &amp; ſoft, and the other by ſex. Whereby teares both eaſily flow, and are ſupplied with plentifull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if with rarenes of body and humidity, the braine aboue the reſt exceede that way: and the eyes be great, &amp; vaynes &amp; paſſages there about large: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth ther nothing to the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of tears, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſmal occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily they which haue their bodies drier by nature, and more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and the paſſages and poores cloſe, as men in compariſon of women &amp; children: ſuch hardly yeeld forth that ſigne of ſorrow though the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may require it. Thus you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what occaſion moueth weeping, how taken, and what ſtate of bodie they be of, that eaſily water their cheekes, when ſorow and calamitie afflicteth. Now let vs conſider the matter of teares, what it is, and whence particularly, and properly they flow, and manner how. The matter is the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humiditie of the brayne, not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the vaynes: for elſe would teares not be cleare, nor of a wateriſh colour: but reſembling the colour of vrine, receiue a tincture from the thinneſt parte of the blood, and ſo appeare yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, except the ſtraining of the humour might ſeeme to clarifie them, which can not ſo be. For, ſtraining, although it caſt away impuritie, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth not colour: as ſtrayne claret wyne as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you will, it keepeth ſtil the colour. Againe the tincture of yellow; being of a cholericke whay in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6813:85"/>the blood which is moſt thinne, would nothing hinder the paſſage of the teare, nor remaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the ſtrainer. Then we may reſolue vpon this point, that teares riſe of the brains, thinneſt &amp; moſt liquide excrement; whereof (being the moyſteſt part of the whole bodie, and twiſe ſo much in quantitie as the braine of an oxe) it hath great plenty, euen more then anie other part, both in reſpect of his temper, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This excrement is voyded ordinarily by the palate, the noſe, and the eyes, by certaine paſſages ordained for vaines, arteries, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, from that carnell which is placed in the ſadle of the bone called the wedge, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ouer the palate of the mouth: this carnell is there placed, that the excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t might not ruſh ſuddenly into theſe parts, but gently diſtill into them. The moſt ordinarie paſſage of thinne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is by the pallate and noſe: the pallate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth it directly, the noſe from the eyes; leſt they ſhould be moleſted by continuall fluxe: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eyes it floweth by the paſſage of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond couple of nerues, which ſerue to moue the eye, not entering the ſubſtance of them, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on all ſides floweth to the eyes, and from thence is receaued of the fleſhly carnell in the inner corner of the eye, and ſo paſſeth into the noſe, and voydeth out, to purge the head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and this is the ordinarie courſe of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie, which voyded from the braine into the noſe. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grief, or trouble of ſmoke or wind, this thinne liquor floweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all partes, &amp; is receaued of another fleſhly carnell vnder the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6813:86"/>vpper eye lid towards the eares, &amp; from thence alſo watereth them, and trickleth downe the cheekes. So then you perceaue the matter of teares, &amp; by what ſtreames it voydeth, and how it is conueighed: it remaineth laſt of all to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto you what cauſeth the fluxe out of the eyes, ſeeing ordinarily it ſhould paſſe into the noſe, or through the palate be voyded out at the mouth; and how in weeping, nature diſchargeth her ſelf of this excrement. For clearing of which point, you muſt call to remembrance the kinde of paſſion, wherewith nature is charged in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of griefe or feare; which is an enforcement of flight into her owne center, not hauing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elſe to flee: whereby ſhe gathereth in one her ſpirits, and bloud, &amp; calleth them in, partly withdrawing them from that fearefull obiect, &amp; partly by vniting of forces, inableth her ſelfe to make greater reſiſtance againſt that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyeth. Theſe ſpirites are ſuch as paſſe from the principall partes, of the heart, braine, and liuer, and giue life, nouriſhment, ſenſe and motion to the reſt of the members of our bodies. So then the braine being thus repleniſhed with his flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirites, is fuller then it was before, and of neceſſitie warmer, heat alwayes accompanying ſpirit: with the ſpirite, refloweth alſo the bloud, and humours: and that all may become ſafe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh ſuch contraction of the ſubſtaunce of the braine, and partes thereabout, that as one deſirous to hold faſt with his hand that which is apt to flowe forth, loſeth by his hard handlinge and compreſſion, which otherwiſe he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6813:86"/>ſo it expreſſeth that which by thinneſſe is readie to voide, and forcing with ſpirit, &amp; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with contracted ſubſtance, ſignifieth by ſhower of teares, what ſtorme toſſeth the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted hart, and ouercaſteth the cheerfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce. And this is the manner of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the ſorowfull cheekes, and viſage disfigured with lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which being by this double meanes inforced, iſſue in more plentie, then the paſſage into the noſtrells can readilie diſcharge: the aboundance whereof drencheth the eyes, &amp; ouerflowing the brimmes of the eye liddes, filleth the boſome with teares. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the noſe to runne, and the mouth to ſlauer: euen the ſudden breach of theſe waters, faſter ſeeking vent, then agreeth with natures ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie auoydaunce. They are ſalt of taſt, through that heate of the eye, which turneth eaſily that excrement into ſaltneſſe, beſides the mixture of the ſalt humiditie which is alwayes about it. For the eye of any one being touched with the tong, giueth a manifeſt releaſe of ſaltneſſe: which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of that moyſt excrement, altered into ſuch taſt by the eyes heate. That the eyes be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in heate, beſides manifeſt experience of of touch, the plenty of ſpirit which they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily poſſeſſe, the ſtore of arteries and vaines, the plenty of fat round about, the celeritie of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do argue ſufficiently the ſame. Neither is that ordinarie paſſage of humidity fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the brain, whereby their heate may be tempered, leſt they become thereby ſore, and withered, the leaſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their hote temper, which is not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6813:87"/>to any part of the bodie the hart onely excepted. Laſtly the aptneſſe to be offended with heate, and readie offence taken that way, ſufficiently declareth whereto their nature ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>VVhy and howe one weepeth for ioy, and laugheth for griefe: why teares and weeping indure not all the time of the cauſe; and why the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is put in the eye.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former chapter mention was made of weeping for ioy: here you may demaund a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why a ioyfull paſſion, yeeldeth forth ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull an action; neither do they that weepe faine, as a man will counterfet laughter: for tears cannot be counterfetted, becauſe they riſe not of any action or facultie voluntarie, but naturall: &amp; the weeping cauſed of ioy is as hartie, as that which riſeth vpon conceit of ſorowe. We do ſee in the works of nature contrary effects wrought by the ſame cauſe; ſo the ſame effect enſueth vpon contrary cauſes, through the diuerſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the working. You ſee how the Sunne alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the whiteneſſe of a mans skinne into black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and how it maketh cloth white, it ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth waxe, and hardeneth clay. Againe we ſee howe the cold withereth the herbe, as doth the heate: and cauſeth the earth to be warme, that the fountains ſmoke againe, as doth the Sunne: and is as requiſite with vs in his ſeaſon, for the fertilitie of the earth, as the reflexion of the Sunne beames. What maruell then, if contraries
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6813:87"/>in paſſions bring forth like effects; as to weepe &amp; laugh, both for ioy &amp; ſorow? For as it is oft ſeene that a man weepeth for ioy, ſo is not ſtraunge to ſee one laugh for griefe; whereof examples are dayly: as if a man taketh vp that which is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hote, hauing thought it had bin cold, he will laugh at the hurt he feeleth: likewiſe if one aſſay to handle another mans wound, the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded will declare the diſcontentment with laughter: euen as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is tickled, will laugh though he take no pleaſure in tickling, but rather miſlike &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. With ſuch kind of laughter did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus grieue at the vanities of this life: which alſo moued Heraclitus to weep. And ſometimes in vrgent diſtreſſe, the anguiſh and vexation of mind, is declared w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this kind of Sardonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if the hart toke pleaſure, wherat it is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. This is cleare, &amp; needeth no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger diſcours: the reaſon is not ſo euident, which I will nowe make plaine vnto you. As you heard before how teares in ſorowe do iſſue out of the eyes by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that internal fulneſſe of ſpirits, &amp; heat which forceth out theſe teares; ſo ioy &amp; gladnes being an enlargement of the hart, &amp; braine, &amp; all the internal parts, eſpecially of the ſpirits, which do as it were iſſue out, to welcome the ioyfull obiect, partly thaough the enlargement of the paſſages, &amp; partly through the acceſſe of ſpirits to the outward parts, the moyſture before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is forced out of the eyes, &amp; diſtilleth into drops of teares: eſpecially if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſeration &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be mixed therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>: ſuch was Ioſephs weping ouer his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; framed of ioy of their preſence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6813:88"/>and compaſſion of their eſtate: and ſo did Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than weepe ouer Dauid; and Dauid ioying at Ionathans kindeneſſe, with commiſſeration of his teares, exceeded him in weeping. This moſt commonly falleth out, when he whom we loue hath eſcaped daunger, or we thinke through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer longe abſence, ſomewhat vnproſperous might, or hath befallen him. Nowe the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the preſent ſafety, mingled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of perill or want, for the preſent, breaketh out into teares, which are eaſily to be voyded, both through compreſſion, as hath bin before ſhewed, and by forcible expulſion. I ſee you deſire farther, as well why griefe procureth laughter, as ſtrange an effect from the cauſe, as teares are from ioy &amp; comfort. Before I lay this open vnto you, ye are to knowe what partes are firſt affected with laughter, and how they drawe others into the ſame fellowſhip of action. The parts which firſt are affected in laughter, are the hart and the midriffe, wherto the hart by his call and skinne is more ſtraightly faſtened then in beaſts; the obiect of laughter being a ridiculous thing, mixed of pleaſure and diſpleaſure (elſe were it not ridiculous) cauſeth the hart to moue with great celerity his contrary motions of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſhutting, which being ſo repugnaunt, cauſe a maruelous agitation in the part, by this agitation, and ſtraight coupling of the heart to the midriffe, which draweth by conſent other parts into like motion, the laughter is deliuered by interrupted expiration: by reaſon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe in his contraction is not ſuffered quietly to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6813:88"/>finiſh it, but is by the harts trouble reſtrained &amp; ſlowed in his fall. Thus knowing the cauſe of laughter, and the inſtruments of the geſture, I ſhall more eaſily manifeſt vnto you, why a man may ſometimes laugh for griefe and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as weep for ioy. Of all the muſcles in the bodie, the midriffe is the moſt noble, and of greateſt vſe, whoſe action is in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and neuer ceaſeth, not ſo much as in ſleep (when all the reſt take their eaſe) for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of breathing: with this muſcle do accord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe others; eſpecially thoſe of the neather iaw and cheekes and lippes, taking their nerues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fourth couple increaſed by the ſixt, which riſe from the pith of the chine in the necke. So then, the midriffe being affected with any kinde of extraordinarie motion (as it is in grief) eaſily draweth the cheekes, and lippes into like motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But how is the midriffe affected in griefe? euen much like as it is in laughter: that is to ſay, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in his free falling by the contraction of the hart, which in griefe calleth in his ſpirits, cloſeth it ſelfe, &amp; filleth the neighbour parts with more ſtore of bloud then is ordinarie; which being ſo repleniſhed, the midriffe is drawne with the call of the hart, and hath not his owne libertie in his contraction: by which meanes the expiration is deliuered by fits, and not wholly, as in ordinary breathing, the midriffe (reſembling in vſe the leather of a paire of bellows) being ioyned rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about to the ſides of the cheſt: which aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the two boords of the bellowes. This alſo draweth the conſent of the lippes and cheekes,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6813:89"/>the muſcles thereof agreing with the midriffe in their nerues, which make like contractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that in laughter, after a counterfet manner in paine and ache that one preſently feeleth or feareth. The other kinde, which is of griefe of minde, as that of Hanniball for the diſtreſſe of Carthage, and his preſent calamitie, is of a mixed cauſe, compounded of ſome ioy, which riſeth of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of remedie or reuenge, which cauſeth a dilatation of ioy, entermeddled with contractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of griefe: ſo a man that hath receaued a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his enemy, and aſſured howe he may be euen with him, will laugh, though he haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at the diſpleaſure, vpon hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance: whereof riſeth a certaine ioye mixed with griefe, that forceth out a Sardonian, bitter laughter, ſhort, and ouertaken with more griefe, which with vapor and ſpirit, through that dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the hart, ſilleth the cheekes, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their muſcles to be withdrawne to their heads, ſhew their teeth, and faſhion the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance into that kind of grinning which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in laughter. Thus much by the way of laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by occaſion of that weeping, which falleth vnto ſuch as vpon cauſe of ioy breake out into teares. If you deſire to knowe more of this merie geſture, I referre you to a treatiſe of laughter, written by Laurence Ioubert of Mountpellier, a Philoſopher, and Phiſitian, in my iudgement not inferiour to any of this age. The cauſe why wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping endureth not all the time of the ſorow, but moſt commonly at the firſt brunt onely of griefe tears are ſhed, is partly by reaſon time acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6813:89"/>the hart with the ſorowe, ſo is the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction leſſe, the daunger not being ſo ſtraunge. Againe, that moyſture is partly emptied, which miniſtreth matter vnto teares, &amp; reaſon in time dealeth with the affection, which peraduenture moderateth the griefe, whereby it leſſe vrgeth. The finger is vſually put in the eye in weeping, by reaſon the teare falling into the eye with his ſaltneſſe procureth a kind of itching about the carnell of teares, which requireth ayde of the ſinger to be expreſſed at their firſt fal: afterward the part acquainted with that qualitie, and one teare drawing on another, ſuch expreſſion is not ſo neceſſarie. Beſides this cauſe of rubbing the weeping eye, a ſtrange matter therin requireth wyping, which alſo moueth the finger to haſt to the eye watered with teares: but this is after a while; the other before almoſt anie teare fall, as though they were expreſſed with rubbing. And thus much touching the cauſes of teares, which beare the greateſt part in weeping: nowe ye ſhall vnderſtand howe other partes of that geſture are perfourmed, and by what meanes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN weeping the countenance is caſt downe, by reaſon the ſpirits are retracted, which are the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6813:90"/>authors (by tonicall motion) of erection: as a maſte corded on all ſides ſtandeth erect: which in ſorow being withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the muſcle, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to yeeld to the poyſe of the head: and ſo bendeth it downeward, wherto it is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined then backeward: by reaſon the rowells of the neckbone, with their ſnaggs hinder that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. The forehead lowreth after a parali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall faſhion, being deſtitute of his ſpirites, and all the former partes filled with that excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious moiſture of teares before mentioned: which is in that aboundance in perſons moiſt of braine, tender and rare of poores, that not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t way at the eyes, it paſſeth through the noſe, as the other part by the palate into the mouth, and ſo filleth all full of teares and ſlauer. The lipe trembleth, becauſe the ſpirite which ſhould vphold it in his right poſition, is now in greateſt meaſure departed: ſo that the waight of the lippe, ſtriuing with the imbecillitie of the parte, cauſeth a trembling, which is betwixt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and plaine declination: as if a man hold a thing too heauy till he beginne to be weary: though at the firſt he hold it ſteady, at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ſtriuing aboue his power to beare it, maketh his hand to quake and tremble, the remnaunte of ſtrength, ſtriuing with the weight. The vpper lippe remaineth ſteadie and ſtill, becauſe it han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and requireth no proppe of erection: yet appeareth it ſomewhat longer then before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully ſtretched out with the weight, and not borne vp, &amp; reſtrained by the ſpirit. The cheeks are drawen much like as in laughter: not by any
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6813:90"/>influence of the liuely ſpirite, which in laughter repleniſheth the countenance, and cauſeth the eyes to ſparcle, and filling the muſcles of the cheekes with a ſubtle vapour, cauſeth them to ſtrayne for the auoydance: as in ſtreaking, the muſcles are contracted to exclude a vaporous excrement: but the contraction of the cheekes in weeping ſeemeth to me, not to riſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, then by an excrementitious vapour, which paſſeth with the humiditie of teares, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the braine into the cheekes, and forceth nature to make contraction to diſcharge it ſelfe of that vapour: ioyned with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, which is betwixt the muſcles of the iawes and lipps with the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe: whoſe remiſſion, and ſlackening, being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened by the contraction of the harte in griefe, contracteth alſo the foreſaid lipps and cheekes, with which it conſenteth by the fourth and ſixt paire of nerues, deriued into both partes, from the marow of the chine bone of the neck. Theſe are alſo the cauſes, of the whole deformitie of the face in weeping, which chiefely contracteth the viſage in expiration, in which the heart hath more power ouer the mydriffe being ſlakened, then in inſpiration, wherein by dilating of the cheſt for vſe of breath it is exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. The ſpeach is interrupted in weeping, becauſe the cheſt in expiration doth not fall and ſinck, by gentle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination equally: but hindred by that contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, remitteth his extenſion, as it were by ſtroakes: as if a man would take a paire of bellowes, and not ſuffer them being enlarged, and full of aire to ſhutt of themſelues, but by an
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6813:91"/>vnequall preſſing of the handes, cauſe them to puffe by fittes, and part the blowing into ſundry blaſtes, which at once might be auoyded. So the voyce riſing of the ayre expired, as that is voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in like ſort the voyce is fraimed: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe that weepe to ſpeake more indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diuided ſentences, then when they are free from that affection. Moreouer ſpeach doth require not onely the yeeldinge of the cheſt through the poyſe, but ſtandeth in neede alſo of the intercoſtall muſcles, and thoſe of the top of the windpipe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bely which throgh griefe or feare being now not ſo repleniſhed with ſpirites, the authors of motion of thoſe muſcles, can not deliuer the voyce ſmoth and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme as before, more then a childe is able ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficiently to way downe by his ſtrength of hand a ſmithes bellow, that is forced by poyces to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that which ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth would perform at once.

               </head>
               <p>BEſides the former actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſorow, weping is for the moſt part accompanied (if it be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) with ſobbes and ſighes: of which two, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing is neuer without weeping, ſighes are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and common vppon cauſes that force no teares, as euery one hath experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the cauſes of ſobbes, it is neceſſarie for you to call to minde that which hath bin ſaid of the vſe of the Diaphragma, or midriffe, and the outward intercoſtalls, or outward muſcles betwixt the ribbes, and the manner how the hearte is affected in griefe and ſorrowe. The dilating of Diaphragma is to enlarge the cheſt for taking breath. This is onely required, if we be not more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinarilie vrged to breath: which if we be, then doe the outwarde muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the ribbes dilate the cheſt alſo, and ſo encreaſe the inlargement. Now when matter of griefe inforceth teares, the Diaphragme, and the muſcles receiue a weakenes, by reaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of ſpirites, that they are faine for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of the cheſt to make mo pulls then one, as you heard before in the motion of contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that the breath is not drawen at one ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their coares and fibers, but by diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: beſides the heat of thoſe partes being retracted, maketh them leſſe plyable vnto the force of the muſcles: whereby the reſpiration is with more difficultie perfoormed, which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6813:92"/>requireth more vſe of dilatation, then before: by reaſon the heate about the heart it ſelfe is now greater then before the paſſion, which bringeth thereto a kind of ſuffocation. That cooling of the heart which is ſenſibly felt by ſuddaine euill tydinges, or miſhappe vnlooked for, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer new calamitie, riſeth through acceſſe of the blood and ſpirits: which although they be hote, yet wanting ſomewhat of that heate which is ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and naturall to the heart, and of the heat of thoſe ſpirites which are reſident there, for the time ſeemeth to coole in compariſon of the heat which the heart felt before: as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would caſt hote water to that which boyleth moſt feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which although it be hote, yet inferiour in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the heate of feruentnes, it mitigateth the ſcalding heate, and ſlaketh the boyling. In like manner at the firſt recourſe of theſe humours, and raunging ſpirites, although the heart ſeeme to receiue a chilling, yet anone by contraction, and plenty of ſpirites which are apt to take heat it receiueth a greater neceſſitie of breathing, which being not aunſwered through imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the breathing parts, diſchargeth the office of reſpiration by ſobbes, which ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſormed by one draught of breath. And theſe I take to be the cauſes of ſobbing. Sighing hath no other cauſe of mouing then to coole and refreſh the hearte, with freſh breath, and pure aire, which is the nouriſhment and foode of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirites, beſides the cooling which the heart it ſelfe receiueth thereby. The heart being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as hath bene ſaid, deliuereth not ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6813:92"/>his ſootie and ſmokie excrementes, whereby the ſpirites become impure, and it boyleth with more diſtemper: which neceſſitie of freſh ſpirite and coole ayre enforceth a deeper enlargement of the cheſt then is ordinarie; in which not only the midriffe playeth his parte, but outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtalls or middle muſcles of the ribbes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides certaine of the ſhoulders, doe their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to this ſo neceſſary an office. Moreouer it is very probable that the midriffe by acceſſe of humours and vapours to the partes there about is charged with vaperous ſuperfluitie, which is by ſtretching it ſelfe, as in yawning, auoyded: when the muſcles are diſtended by any vapour, of what ſort ſoeuer it be of, being plentifull and aboundant, it ſtirreth them to a contraction, which cauſeth a kinde of preſſing, wherby they deliuer themſelues of this excrement. This in yawning cauſeth that gaping, &amp; ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſtreaking, when we finde our ſelues vnluſtie, and vndiſpoſed to ſtirre or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: which falling to the midriffe, may cauſe a kinde of ſighing, when a man hath no cauſe: as hauing cauſe, it helpeth it foreward. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer yawneth, ſhall perceiue his cheſt and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe dilated in ſuch manner as in ſighing, &amp; feele about the heart a kinde of refreſhing: euen as when he ſigheth. To theſe cauſes may be added the weight of the hart, which is by reaſon of the acceſſe of humours about his vaynes and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to his contraction, increaſed: whereby it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more heauily vpon the midriffe then before the burthen whereof it ſeeketh to eaſe it ſelf of,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6813:93"/>by ſuch ſtreitching, which ſomewhat lifteth vp the hearte for the time, and ſo the Diaphragma is reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted: ſo that the neceſſity of freſh aire, the cooling of the hearte, the eaſing of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then therof vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the midriffe, the auoiding of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous excrements out of the midriffe, ſeeme to me cauſes final, &amp; the midriffes dilatatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe motion the whole cheſt followeth the efficient cauſe of ſobing &amp; ſighing. And thus much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the two dolorous actions of ſighing &amp; ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, whereto after I haue added how it eaſeth the heart to weepe &amp; ſobbe, I will end this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. By reaſon of the withdrawing of the blood &amp; ſpirites about the heart in feare, and ſorow, it is neceſſary, that much vapour ſhould ariſe, ſtirred vp by the heat therof working vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moiſture theſe vapours beſides the ordinarie excrements of the brayne before mentioned, may yeeld ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte vnto teares, being congeled in the brayne, and vpper partes that are thicke, coole, membranous, incloſed with the skull, and placed ouer the reſt, as a ſtillitorie helme ouer the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Now weeping by making auoyda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to theſe vapours, doth diſcharge that fulnes wherewith it was before ſtrayned and oppreſſed. Theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours cauſe that rednes in the cheekes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the eares of thoſe that weepe, heateth the face, and cauſeth the head to ake, whereof the heart being eaſed, receiueth a farther enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then at the beginning of the griefe, and ſo enioyeth that ſmall comfort which weeping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth. It may ſeeme probable that the ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and ſighing (differing onely in that ſobbes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6813:93"/>are ſighinges interrupted, and ſighes ſobbes at large) if they be not vehement and long by agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the cheſt expelling of the ſmothered vapours, and drawing in of freſh aire, geue alſo ſome comfort: if they be vehement, then ſhake they the hart and midriffe too much, and cauſe a ſoreneſſe about thoſe partes, eſpecially about the hart ſpoone, which is moſt trauelled in ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and whereto the midriffe is faſtened. Thus much concerning thoſe actions which are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and ly in our power (ſome abſolutely, and ſome after a ſort) to do or not to do, altered by paſſion of ſorowe, and falling into melancholie perſons: it reſteth to ſhewe, howe melancholie procureth this laughing and weeping, and ſo to proceede to thoſe naturall actions which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by this humour, with the reaſon of ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

               <p>IT hath bene before declared how melancholy cauſeth feare and ſorowe of hart, by falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, raiſed through fearefull vapours riſing to the braine, and paſſing by the hart, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the imagination be moued, cauſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction thereof: which is the action of feare: this feare breedeth ſorowe; the ſorow and feare accompanying ech other, make ſuch contractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as before hath bene ſayde to be cauſe of teares;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:6813:94"/>the matter being partly ſupplied by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excrements of the braine, and partly through thoſe vapours which ariſe from the hart ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with concourſe of humours, which are retracted by the ſpirites; who vpon matter of diſcontentment haſt vnto the place of defence, and aſſemble together, flying the irkſome obiect, and addreſſing them ſelues as it were to make reſiſtance. The partes about the eyes being po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and rare, the braine moyſt, and the partie apt to weepe, vpon this melancholie diſpoſition ſpringeth that iſſue of teares out of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke eyes: and theſe I ſuppoſe to be the cauſes, why melancholicke perſons without anie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occaſion, fall into weeping and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why they laugh, and that exceſſiuely, the cauſe is of more difficultie to finde out, and the reaſon not ſo manifeſt, whereof as I am ledde by coniecture and probabilities, I will deliuer you mine opinion. You may remember how the midriffe next vnto the hart is the chiefe cauſe of laughter; ſo that of neceſſitie one of theſe muſt be affected in that action. The heart is alwayes affected in true laughter, and not alwayes in a fained kind, which is only a ſhaking of the cheſt, and retraction of the lippes, without the liuely and chearfull eye, fraught with the ioyfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, which repleniſh the merie countenaunce. This kinde is that which melancholicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without obiect breake out into; except the melancholie riſe of aduſtion of bloud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come blacke choller, which affecteth alſo the heart with a faigned conceit of merineſſe; euen
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6813:94"/>as wine giueth it comfort, and ſtirreth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to that liuelines &amp; cheare, wherof euery one hath experience. Nowe then for the better lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open this melancholick action, we are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of laughter: wherof there be two ſorts; the one is true and vnfaigned, riſing from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and reioycing of the hart; and the other a counterfet and falſe, wherein the heart recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no contentment, but either it ſelfe, or the midriffe moued diſſorderly with ſhaking by anie annoyance; and moueth alſo the cheſt, and muſcles of the iawes and checkes by conſent of nerues, and ſo counterfetting a laughinge ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, wherein the heart taketh no pleaſure. The former kinde may riſe of inward cauſe, as well as outward; when the vapour of aduſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie of bloud, or rather when it firſt taketh that heate, perfumeth the heart with a pure &amp; cleare fume, whereat it is allured to ioye and cheare: which vapour and fume riſinge of the moſt mildeſt and temperate humour, before the full aduſtion be accompliſhed, and mixed with the other humours and ſpirites, breedeth that pleaſaunt vaine, which ouertaketh melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke perſons, which peraduenture other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not ſo delayed, would turne the heart to annoyance. This way melancholie carrying a winie and aromaticall ſpirit, raiſed by that heat, may procure an harty laughter, &amp; not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as wine doth, the ſpirit thus rayſed being more familiar the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of wine, &amp; ſo compelling as it were the hart to break forth into that actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reioycing. The falſe kinde of laughter which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:6813:95"/>proceedeth firſt from the midriffe, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is affected by melancholie, through a tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling vapor or ſpirite, which riſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lower parts, and ſtirreth the midriffe; as they which are wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the cheſt, and vpon dreſſing are there about touched, do plainly perceaue to moue, &amp; ſhake, and retract it ſelfe, (whoſe motion the cheſt followeth) and to force out a count erfet manner of laughter, whereof the hart hath no part; nor countenance, ſauing the girning of the mouth, which is here but ſmall, maketh anie pleaſant ſhew. This accident pertaineth chieflie to that melancholie which reſteth about the ſplene, the meſaraicke vaines, and port vayne of the liuer; which breatheth an itching and tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling breath, whereof the midriffe takinge the ſence, ſhaketh &amp; moueth, with indeuour to ſhun the vnwelcome gheſt, and to auoyde the touch thereof. Now that being once moued, the other inſtruments of laughter aunſwere with like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all agree in this counterfet geſture, which in appearance ſeemeth like the pleaſaunt looke of a light and merily diſpoſed hart. This accident of laughter for the moſt part is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the melancholy paſſion beginneth, or anon after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bloud getteth a farther egerneſſe, and thoſe iolie ſpirites be waſted: which after they once be ſpent, &amp; the heat either outragious, or delayed or diſtinguiſhed by vnaptnes of matter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the comedy turned into tragedy, pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes into fury, &amp; in the end, mirth into mourning much like as it fareth with ſuch as intemperatly take in their cups, &amp; are ouer ſurfeted with wine
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6813:95"/>or ſtrong drink; theſe of them that are of nature cold and dry, &amp; of this melancholie complexion voyd of aduſtion, at the firſt cup receaue a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous cheering about the hart, the drineſſe and coldneſſe of their inward parts being ſoked and ſteeped as it were, like dry leather in oyle: if they proceed farther, the former modeſtie anon alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelfe into the contrarie extremitie of chat and exceſſiue babling, the ſpirit of the wine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruling the ſpirit of their natural complexion: yet a litle more ſipping, and this melancholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth ſuch heat, as rage and furie entreth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of hart, and braine; and as he had taken a draught of Circes cup, he fareth in reſpect of maners &amp; behauiour, as though he were turned into a wild beaſt. In the end with farther carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of exceſſe, the wine, for the while quite diſpoſ ſeſſing the ſpirits of their regiment &amp; office, and quenching as it were the one heate, &amp; delaying the naturall heat of his body with immoderate qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity, the mirth &amp; chere, the pleaſant talk, the rage &amp; furie giue place, &amp; in ſteed of that iolitie, ſuccedeth ſilence, ſtupiditie, ſleep &amp; ſottiſhneſſe. So in mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholie, while that drie &amp; ſubtile ſpirit is ſupplied with conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter, &amp; is lightned in the melancholick part, all is on the hoigh for a time, which being conſumed by heat, the ſtore therof being but ſmall in reſpect of the groſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the melancholick perſon becometh after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſad, heauy, &amp; vncherful. Thus you perceiue (I think) ſufficiently how melancholick perſons, ſome laugh &amp; ſome weepe, &amp; in the ſame melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke, what cauſeth mirth, &amp; what teares. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6813:96"/>I proceede to the naturall actions chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and depraued by melancholy, I cannot paſſe ouer an action which is verie vſuall to melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke folke, and that is bluſhing, with ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the looke and countenaunce of men, which the Grecians call Dyſopia; and becauſe it requireth a larger diſcourſe then the ende of this Chapter will ſuffer, I will treate of them in the next.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE affection that moueth bluſhinge is ſhame, howſoeuer it riſeth, either vppon falſe conceit, or deſerued cauſe. Shame is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of griefe, mixed with anger againſt our ſelues, riſing of the conſcience of ſome knowne, or ſuppoſed to be knowne offence, either in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which ought not to be done, or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which was requiſite of vs to be done. This deſcription I will vnfold vnto you more at large: that in ſhame euery one is grieued, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience maketh plaine, beſides reaſon leadeth thereunto. Euerie paſſion of the heart is with ioye, or with griefe, either ſincere and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or mixed, as in ridiculous occaſions: in ſhame there is no abſolute ioye nor comfort, therefore there muſt needs be a diſpleaſantneſſe or elſe a mixt diſpoſition of ſorowe and cheare: this there is not, by reaſon ſhame caſteth downe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6813:96"/>the countenance, filleth the eye with ſorow, and as much as may be withdraweth the liuely and comfortable ſpirit into the center of the bodie, not vnlike vnto feare and ſadneſſe. It appeareth mixed with anger, by reaſon euerie one feeleth a kinde of indignation within him ſelfe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth as it were a vehement inablinge of him ſelfe: for the offence wee are angrie with our ſelues, becauſe the fault is ours, and from vs ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the cauſe of griefe; as in abſolute anger the cauſe is from other, and vpon others we ſeeke the reuenge. Where there is no conſcience, there can not be any ſenſe of fault: for that it is which layeth our actions to the rule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth them good or bad: ſo although the fault be committed in deede, and yet no conſcience made thereof, it is taken for no offence, neither can giue cauſe of this internall grief &amp; reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To theſe clauſes I ad an offence knowne, or ſo ſuppoſed: for otherwiſe, though a man be grieued and ſorie therefore, yet before it be knowne to others is he not aſhamed. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that men make no doubt of doing that in ſecret, which for ſhame they would not do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yea in ſuch thinges as of them ſelues are not diſhoneſt, nor diſalowable. Moreouer, it riſeth vpon offence, committed in that thing which lay in our power (as we tooke it) to remedie, or better to haue diſcharged our ſelues in doing or omitting. Therefore no man is aſhamed of an ague, or of the goute, or to haue broken his legges, or anie ſuch occaſion, as to haue bene ſpoyled, or to die &amp;c. but onely in thoſe thinges
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6813:97"/>wherein we take our ſelues to haue our part, and to riſe vpon our owne default: ſo are we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the action, and of all tokens thereof. Nowe ſeing that all offence, is neither in doing amiſſe, or neglecting that ſhould be done, in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both conſiſteth matter of ſhame. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſhame thus being declared, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to ſhewe howe it forceth redneſſe into the eares and cheekes, and cauſeth vs neither to beare other mens countenaunces and lookes, nor with courage and boldneſſe to beare vp our owne. The griefe that nature conceaueth from our ſelues, is not ſo ſtraunge, as that which is foraine, and outward, but farre more familiar, and thence therefore in all partes more known. Moreouer the cauſe is more tranſitorie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; eſpecially, if the offence be ſmall and of no great note. Againe the griefe is not for anie depriuation of that, whereof the vſe is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, as loſſe of friendes, goodes, perill, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie do all import, nor of anie ſingular pleaſure, wherein nature or will tooke their chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Theſe qualities of ſhame ioyned with anger, procureth that redneſſe in the face, which we call bluſhing. The tincture of redde ariſeth on this ſort: the heart diſcontented with the openneſſe of the offence, maketh a retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of bloud, and ſpirit at the firſt, as in feare and griefe; and becauſe it feeleth no greater hurt then of laughter, or rebuke of worde, or ſuch like touch, ſeeketh no farther eſcape, then a ſmall withdrawing of the ſpirite and bloud by the firſt entrance of the perturbation: ſo that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6813:97"/>the neceſſitie being no more vrgent, the bloud and ſpirit breake forth againe more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fill the partes about the face more then before, and cauſeth the redneſſe. This is helped forwarde with that anger, which is mixed with ſhame, which forceth in ſome ſorte, theſe retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſpirites and bloud to reflowe with more ſtrength, as we ſee the bloud ſoone vp of a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke perſon. The paſſion is not ſo vehement to cloſe vp the ſpirits, and to retaine anie longer time, for the cauſe before alledged; and although it were, yet would the anger, and inwarde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement make way to the bloud and ſpirites, to geue that ſhamefaſt colour. Thus you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what maner of perturbation cauſeth blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, what it is, and how it breedeth the ſtaine: but you wil peraduenture ſay, why do not all that are aſhamed bluſh, and why ſome more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome? This I ſuppoſe to be cauſe: in bluſhing theſe pointes are to be conſidered for anſwer of this queſtion; the qualitie of the bloud and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the paſſage, &amp; nature or ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the face, which receiueth this reflux. If the blud be groſſe and thicke, and the paſſages not ſo free, then is the courſe of bloud ſlow, &amp; the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance little altered. If the skin be ouer thick, or ouer rare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth it not admit throgh the thicknes of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, or at the leaſt maketh not that ſhew, nor retaineth them through the rarenes and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and by exoperation make no apparaunce of rednes: this is the cauſe why many aſhamed be not ſo ready to bluſh. Beſides this diſpoſition of ſpirite, humour and ſubſtance of the face, the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6813:98"/>meaſure of the ſhame more or leſſe, helpeth and hindereth bluſhing. For ſome there are affected more vehemently, and otherſome moderately, &amp; otherſome not a whit: who bluſh not, becauſe they are not at all aſhamed. By that hath bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared you may gather, why the yonger ſort, and women eaſily bluſh: euen through rarenes of their body and ſpirites, ioyned with ſimplicitie, which cauſeth doubt of offence: and this is the cauſe why we commend bluſhers, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth a tender heart, and eaſily moued with remorſe of that which is done amiſſe, &amp; a feare to offend, and a care leaſt it ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ought worthy of blame. Furthermore it ſheweth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience quicke, and tender, and an vpright ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the minde, agreable to this ingrauen maximes of good and euill: and thus much ſhall ſuffice you for bluſhing. As for the ſhunning of mens countenances, and baſhfulnes, either in beholding, or being beheld, it riſeth vpon a gilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in conceite, or in effect, in that we feare is knowen to others wherein we haue offended, or ſtand in doubt we ſhall offend. This conceit cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to hide our ſelues, and to withdraw our preſence from the ſociety of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom we feare doe view our faultes in beholding vs, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our preſence ſtirreth vp the remembraunce. Wherefore we being deſirous to couer and hyde our offence, ſeeke alſo to be hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and couered, who haue deſerued the blame: eſpecially from ſuch of whome we haue greateſt reuerence, and of whoſe eſtimation and cenſure we ſtand moſt in awe of. Now becauſe the vewing of another
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6813:98"/>cauſeth the like from him againe, therfore doth the guilty minde abſtaine ther from: that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke not the eye of another whome he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: eſpecially if the other party looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him againe, then is he preſently outcountenanced through the guiltie conceite, and ielouſie of the crime which he ſuſpect to be reueiled. Moreouer the countenance being as it were the grauen character of the mind, the guilty perſon feareth leaſt that be red in his forehead, whereof he is guilty in his heart: which augmenteth the griefe, when he ſeeth himſelfe eyed more then (by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aſide his owne countenance) when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth it not. Thus much touching the former baſhfull actions, whether they riſe vpon cauſe, or opinion only: it remaineth of this chapter to ſhew, how melancholicke perſons are much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to both, though they haue committed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſeruing rebuke, or worthy of ſhame. That which befalleth youth, by their tender age in bluſhing, the ſame in a manner happeneth to melancholicke perſons by their complexion: youth and children, if they come in place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend perſons will eaſily bluſh, not of any fault committed, but of reuerence to the parties: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it were ſecretly in reſpect, condemning her imperfections in that age, whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of both maketh a kinde of compariſon. Moreouer the nature carefull of that which is ſeemely and decent, not acquainted with ſuch preſence, doubteth of error and vncomelineſſe, and diſtruſting it ſelfe, bluſheth as if offence had bene committed. This is the cauſe why the yong
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6813:99"/>take occaſion ſooner then the aged, and why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and vnacquainted preſence cauſeth this paſſion. They which are of mo yeares, by reaſon of experience and further knowledge, which breedeth an aſſurance, more hardly bluſh, and familiarity and cuſtome maketh greater bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Euen ſo the melancholick perſon, through his internall miſlike, and cauſe of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath litle aſſurance or contentment in his actions whatſoeuer: Whereby without cauſe he eaſily groweth into a conceite of ſome abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity committed where none is: this cauſeth him to bluſh, and to expreſſe by outward rednes of colour the internall paſſion: eſpecially this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth him, if he carrie any conſcience of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vice committed: then doth that ouercharge and ſet all out of order, chiefely if it mingle the paſſion with feare, and the quality of the blood and ſpirite, largenes of poores, and diſpoſition of the skinne in the face aunſwere thereunto. But how, will you ſay, can the melancholy perſon haue his ſpirite and blood ſo diſpoſed, which I haue declared to be groſſe and thicke, and the paſſages of their bodies not free? Trueth it is that all melancholicke perſons are not ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to this action of bluſhing, by reaſon they are of blood, ſpirite, and body vnapt thereunto: but certaine only who haue melancholy not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed, but reſteth vnder the ribbes, &amp; anoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth chiefly with his vapour, and who are ſuch not from their parents, but by ſome accident of diet or euill cuſtome, which notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as yet the ſame diſpoſition of their firme
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6813:99"/>partes they had before: or haue ſome other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of thinner ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wherby their blood is not ſo dull of ebbing &amp; flowing: theſe I take to be the melancholick bluſhers only, and the reſt in all reſpects farre remoued there from: whoſe ſwartnes of the skinne with other impediments both hindereth the recourſe of the blood: and if they did bluſh, ouerſhadoweth the colour. The ſame cauſe which ſtirreth bluſhing in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke men, forceth them to auoide aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and publike theaters: and this is common to all melancholickes, howſoeuer they be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in their bodies: euen the opinion and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſome diſgrace from others, who are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with themſelues, and by their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious conceite preuent the ſentence of others vpon themſelues, and condemne that vniuſtly, which ducly wayed, and without paſſion, hath no deſert of blame. Thus much for theſe actions of bluſhing, and baſhfullnes.</p>

               <p>HItherto you haue had declared the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch actions as lie in our power, &amp; are for the moſt part arbitrarie: it followeth to ſhew vnto you the reſt which are natural, &amp; are not at our becke, but are performed by a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of nature wil we, nil we. Theſe actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are of appetite, or of nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of appetite
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6813:100"/>are of meate and drinke, or of procreation. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching appetite of meate, melancholy perſons haue it for the moſt part exceeding, and farre ſurpaſſing their digeſture. The cauſe why, it is through an aboundance of melancholy, which eaſily paſſeth from the ſplene, the ſincke of that humour, to the ſtomach, whoſe ſowernes prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an appetite of nouriſhment, to delay that ſharpnes which moleſteth the mouth thereof: &amp; that you may with more facility conceiue this pointe, marke what I ſhall ſay of the ſplene, the ſtomach, and the paſſage of that humour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. The ſplene lieth vnder the ſhort ribbes on the left ſide of the ſtomach backward, and is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to purge the blood of mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholick iuice, which it draweth vnto it ſelf by meane of vaines, and being ſatisfied with ſome parte wherewith it is nouriſhed, the remnaunte ſower of taſte, and as a naturall ſawce, it belcheth as it were into the ſtomach, whoſe ſharpnes cauſeth a kinde of griefe and knawing therein, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the entrance, which is moſt ſenſible, &amp; ſo prouoketh the appetite of nouriſhment: by whoſe ſweete and familiar iuice, the ſharpnes or ſowernes of the other is dulled and tempered, &amp; ſo the byting eaſed. Beſides this ſence which the quallity of melancholy offereth to the ſtomach it (according to the nature of all thinges of that taſte) bindeth and contracteth the ſtomach: which may alſo be another cauſe of the encreaſe of that paine which inforceth to ſeek after nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Thus then the ſtomach being ſubiect vnto the ſplenetick humour, as it exceedeth or
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6813:100"/>is more ſowre, ſo doth this appetite more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Now in perſons melancholicke, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of this humor is in great aboundance, which thereby the more forceth the appetite: and this I take to be one cauſe of that greedy hunger, which is more inſatiable in melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke men then in others. To this may be added the deſire that nature hath to ſeeke and ſupply, that thicke, groſſe and dry humour, with new &amp; freſh nouriſhment, and to temper the foggy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of that humour, with more cleare, freſh and new: theſe wants of nature happely are another cauſe of that greedy appetite of melancholicke perſons. Their concoction and digeſtion is not aunſwerable to the appetite: through the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſtomach, both by the melancholicke blood, wherewith it is fedder, and more neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the ſplene, which is a part incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from mediocrity to coldnes in temper: this hindereth the concoction. The digeſtion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution faileth through difficulty of paſſage, both by thicknes and ſlownes of the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuice, and narrownes of the way, eſpecially if the partie be by nature, and not through other occaſion melancholicke. To this may be added the dulnes of attractiue power of the parts, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by coldnes and drineſſe, and the vnſauorie iuice, in compariſon of the pure blood, whereof nature is not pricked ſo vehemently with the deſire. Theſe I take to be reaſons of the quicke appetite of melancholicke perſons, and ſlow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and concoction, which partes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diuiſion belonging to nouriſhment, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:6813:101"/>ſhould afterward be handled: but becauſe the compariſon with the appetite miniſtred oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, you ſhall take them in this place, and not looke for them hereafter. Whatſoeuer other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity of naturall action about nouriſhment is depraued by melancholy, the reaſon may be drawne from that hath bin ſhewed of the other. They are not ſo deſirous of drinke, although me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy be a dry humour, both becauſe their coldnes ſtakeneth the thirſt and their ſtomacks be moiſt by want of digeſtion, which ſendeth vp waterie vapours into the mouth, beſides the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the humour it ſelfe, which ſatisfieth the drought if any be, and preuenteth the deſire of drincke. Their ſtomach is cold through melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which by the aboundance which floweth therein from the ſplene is cooled, as alſo by the vicinetie of the ſame, which lyeth cloſe therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The other appetite is of procreation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with or the moſt parte melancholy perſons are more vehemently ſtirred: the cauſe where of I take to be double: the one from the affection of loue, wherewith they are ſoone ouertaken: the other a windy diſpoſition of their bodies, which procureth that deſire. They are allured to loue more eaſily, becauſe they more admire other then themſelues, and being caſt downe with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of their owne imperfection, extoll in their fancy that which hath any ſmall grace of loueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in another. The other reaſon I referre you to reade at large of in treatiſes of philoſophie, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the matter in other languages: the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity and modeſty of our tounge not fitting with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6813:101"/>phraſe to deliuer ſuch problemes. Thus much ſhall ſuffice for the appetite depraued by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie: other ſorts of naturall actions beſides concoction and diſtribution, (which haue bene before ſufficiently to the purpoſe in hande in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of) are the retention ouer faſt, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, or turning of the nouriſhment into our ſubſtances imperfect. The firſt fault riſeth chiefly of the drineſſſe of the parts, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by retaine anie humiditie, the ſlowneſſe of the humour which maketh no way though nature expell; and if it be an excrement that ſhould paſſe, the groſſeneſſe wherewith ſhe hath bene acquainted, cauſeth the offence thereof leſſe to be felt, and ſo nature becommeth more ſluttiſh in cleanſing the bodie of his impurities. Againe the ſenſe of ſuch perſons is not verie quicke, neither carrieth the excrement anie prickinge of prouocation, which ſhould put nature in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of auoydance, except immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantitie ſerue that turne, whereof the drineſſe of melancholicke natures is an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The aſſimilation is faultie by reaſon of colde; this cauſeth that morphewe, which ofte ſtaineth melancholicke bodies, and beſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth their skinne here and there with blacke ſtaines of this humour: &amp; then the nouriſhment in ſteed of ſupplying the perpetuall fluxe of our bodies, and aunſwering in like ſubſtance, is (by fault of the parte of melancholicke diſpoſition) depraued, and turned into like iuyce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the parte is dyed into that blacke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure. The colour is blacke of the nature of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6813:102"/>of the humor, and diſpoſition of the part which by imbecillitie is not able to alter it into white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the ſimilitude of it ſelf. Hitherto I haue declared vnto you what actions melancholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praueth; whether voluntary, or naturall; of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, whether of ſenſe and motion, or of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and perturbation; of naturall whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of appetite, or belonging to the working of nouriſhment: of appetite, whether of victualles, or of luſt: touching dreſſing and preparation of nouriſhment, whether it be coction, digeſtion, attraction, retention, aſſimulation or expulſion: it remaineth to deliuer vnto you, what workes are depraued by this humour, and howe it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the perfection of them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AL the works which riſe of naturall actions in our bodies may be reduced to two ſorts: the one is naturall iuyce, apt for nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp the decay of our bodies through the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of this life and the internall fire, which continually craueth fuell of victuall: the other is a ſuperfluity which riſeth of the maſſe of meats and drinkes, ſeparated from the pure and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, by the triall of our naturall heate: as we ſee the droſſe and impuritie of metalles diſcouered by the fire. This ſuperfluitie nature expelleth out of the bodie, not being of that ſinceritie and familiar qualitie, which nouriſhment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6813:102"/>with. Both theſe are altered by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke diſpoſition, whereof my diſcourſe runneth. The nouriſhing iuyce (by melancholie) of ſuch nouriſhmentes as are pure and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth imperfection, and becommeth groſſer, thicker, and more crude then by the qualitie of the ſubſtance it might be: the rather alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe melancholicke appetite is not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to their digeſtion, but exceedeth. Theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes procure the nouriſhing iuyce thicke, groſſe, and crude, becauſe the heate of melancholicke perſons is abated by this humour; which heat is the worker of ſeparation, and maketh ſubtile &amp; liquide that which of nature hath no contrarie diſpoſition. This nouriſhing iuyce is either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue, and the firſt where of the other take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and matter; or elſe deriuatiue and riſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the primitiue. The primitiue is that which is wrought in the ſtomach, and is in colour white, liquide, equall, of a cremy ſubſtance: in this, as yet, no ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made of place, but wholſome and vnwholſome, excrement and nouriſhment are mixt together; onely there they are as it were diſſolued and broken, and by our heate made more familiar vnto vs, and prepared for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts more eaſie handling This is the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, for cauſes before alleaged, and yeeldeth the excrement voyded by ſtoole, the thickeſt and groſſeſt of all the reſt; which being increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in thoſe qualities by the melancholicke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, moleſteth them with coſtiueneſſe, and hardneſſe of bellie. For through the qualities before mentioned it paſſeth not ſo eaſilie the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6813:103"/>guts, which beſides the foulds they haue, leſt we ſhould be oftener then were meet forced to the ſtoole, they haue plaits ouerthwart, as is to be ſeene in the inwardes of beaſts, which the drie excrement more hardly paſſeth ouer. Againe, ſuch as are enclined to one exceſſe of humour, are for the moſt part leſſe prone to another: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it hath any contrarie qualitie: ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, exceeding through the cooling of the temper, therewith leſſe plenty of choller is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred; which choler nature ſerueth her ſelfe of for a naturall clyſter of the intrailes and guts, both to ſcoure them, and with bitterneſſe to ſtir vp more readily the naturall excretion. Of this humour then melancholicke perſons poſſeſſing but ſmall portion, and the excrement of it ſelfe groſſe &amp; dry, ſtayeth longer in the paſſage, then nature without annoyance may well beare: and this is the cauſe why melancholicke perſons are for the moſt part encumbred with coſtiueneſſe, eſpecially if they be leane with all, (as hardly are they otherwiſe) and want that natural baſting of fat (which ſome haue more then ſufficient) then is this hardneſſe of ſtoole much more increaſed. The nouriſhment thus deliuered of this excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the liuer is turned into bloud, &amp; of white by farther proceſſe of heat is made red. In paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this triall it yeldeth two excrements, the one cholericke, and the other melancholicke, while it remaineth in the liuer, and before it be yet paſſed into the vaines; the cholericke is in her quantitie, except the meates and drinkes of them ſelues do miniſter greater ſtore of that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6813:103"/>matter, elſe their bodies are vnapt for generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that humour; the melancholie is in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, by reaſon of the inclination of the complexion thereunto, &amp; want of pure refining in the liuer; the aboundance wherof is ſuch, that it paſſeth downe from the ſplene with groſſe and melancholie iuyce into the Hemerodes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth of pleuriſies, phrenſies, and madneſſe, (wherto the melancholickes are ſubiect) if their flowe be not too ſparing. This aboundance, and thickneſſe cauſeth their ſplene to ſwell, which is ſayd therefore to procure laughter, becauſe it draweth, and ſucketh the melancholicke excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and purgeth that humour which hath ben before declared to breed ſo many fearful paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and breedeth ſtoppings, whereby it defileth the whole ſupply of the humors. The bloud now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the liuer, &amp; poſſeſſed of the vains, yet leaueth another excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more liquid &amp; thinne then the reſt: this nature disburdeneth it ſelfe of by the vertue of the reins, whoſe office is to ſuck out that thinne humour, &amp; to diſtill it into the bladder, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence after a while nature reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred therof, either by quantity, heat, or ſharpnes deliuereth it quite out of the body. This excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not plentifull in melancholicke perſons, but of colour white, by reaſon of colde, and litle ſtained for want of choler, &amp; thicke of ſubſtance according to the bloud, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it is drawne. The bloud thus purified, and deliuered of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuperfluous excrements, in the ende paſſeth from the great, into the ſmall vaines, and from the ſmall into the priuate poores of euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6813:104"/>and by diuerſe degrees at the length recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſimilitude of our nature, by the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of euerie part, and is vnited in all reſpectes vnto our natural ſubſtance. In this degree of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures worke, ſundrie ſuperfluities ariſe, partly common to all partes, and partly priuate to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. The common is ſweat, wherof melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke perſons are ſpare, through drineſſe, and ſweat requiring heate working vpon a moiſture, which both faile in the melancholicks. For want of ſufficient heate they are not much annoyed that way, neither doth the humours of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies groſſe of ſubſtance deliuer ready matter therunto. The other vniuerſall kind is a kinde of inſenſible ſteme, which breatheth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our bodies, &amp; appeareth on a mans ſhirt, though he haue not ſweat &amp; ſoiled it. This melancholick men haue more foule, then the other eſtates of bodie, and deliuer more plentie, eſpeciallie if their bodies be chafed with exerciſe: for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing free paſſage otherwiſe, for cauſes before mentioned, it ſetleth about the skinne more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, and vppon exerciſe which openeth the poores, &amp; rariſieth the bodie, maketh plaine an outward ſhewe. The particular excrements, eſpecially worth noting, are that voyde from our head, ſtomach, and cheſt. From the head, melancholicke men haue abundance, by reaſon of the ſtomaches cruditie, whoſe vapors it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geleth, or gathereth into rhewme, and diſtilleth it into the mouth. From the ſtomach, it riſeth by the graine of the throte, as you ſee moiſture riſe from the water pot by a clout in watering of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6813:104"/>&amp; cucumbers. The longes voide not much although through want of heate it gathereth of crude excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in thoſe parts, thicker, with leſſe ſenſe of heat, then moderate. Theſe be the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which fall vnto melancholicke perſons, &amp; thus procured: if any haue bene omitted, either they be ſuch as are of no moment to be knowne, or the reaſon of them is eaſily rendred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which hath of the reſt bene ſhewne, neither was my purpoſe in preciſe manner to deliuer theſe points vnto you, as they are to be taught in a ſchoole of Philoſophy, but only to giue you a taſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for better vnderſtanding of your preſent ſtate, and diſcharge of that duetie of friendſhip which your requeſt layeth vpon me in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke theme. This far I haue proceeded in my diſcourſe philoſophically, in laying the whole caſe of melancholie (ſo far as my skill in nature exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth) before you, as the firſt part of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire pretended: hereafter as the order of your requeſt preſcribeth, you ſhal haue mine opinion of that affection which riſeth vpon horror, and conſcience of ſinne, with feare &amp; feelingof Gods reuenging hand againſt the ſame; whether it be any part of melancholy or not; whether melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick perſons are ſubiect moſt therunto; what aduantage Satan taketh in this caſe by the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the bodie; with ſuch other doubts, as your letter miniſtred vnto me; &amp; in the end my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and comfort, and what direction elſe my phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke help wil afford, for reſtoring you to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate of your body, fallen in decay through this humour, and to that tranquillitie of minde,

For as the happines riſing of Gods fauour, beſides the enioying of all bodely and earthly bleſſinges, ſo farre forth as is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for vs, and tending to his glory, is aboue al conceite of mans heart, and reporte of tunge: ſo the contrary eſtate exceedeth all vnderſtanding of the minde, and vtteraunce of ſpeach, and is ſuch as it is aboue meaſure vnhappy and moſt miſerable, inflicted by Gods reuenge, who is himſelf a conſuming fire, and whoſe wrath once kindled, burneth to the bottome of hell. In other miſeries of execution, the miniſter may vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But what doe I deſcribe this vnto you, whoſe preſent experience exceedeth my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? Although it be neceſſary to be laid open, for more cleare diſtinguiſhing thereof from the melancholy paſſions aboue mentioned, and the quality of this miſerie thus being knowne, ſuch as by Godds mercy are yet free, may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his grace therein, pray for the continew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that freedome, and pittie the eſtate of ſuch as grone vnder the burthen of that heauy croſſe, wherein no reaſon is able to miniſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therfore to the end, the one may be reformed in their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the other may thereby take occaſion to reforme their maners, let them conſider that this is a ſorrow and feare vpon cauſe, &amp; that the greateſt cauſe that worketh miſery vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the other contrarily a meere fancy &amp; hath no grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of true and iuſt obiect, but is only raiſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of humour in the fancy, and raſhly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the heart, which vpon naturall credulity faireth in paſſion, as if that were in deede wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the fancy giueth a falſe larume.

In the other, the complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is depraued, obſtructions hinder the free courſe of ſpirits &amp; humors, the blood is ouer groſſe, thick, &amp; impure, &amp; nature ſo diſordered, that diuerſe melancholicke perſons haue iudged themſelues ſome earthie pitchers, otherſome cockes, other

Here it firſt proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mindes apprehenſion: there from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which deluding the organicall actions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth the minde, and draweth it into erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement, through falſe teſtimony of the outward reporte. Here no medicine, no purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no cordiall, no tryacle or balme are able to aſſure the afflicted ſoule and trembling heart, now painting vnder the terrors of God: there in melancholy the vayne opened, neeſing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or bearefoote miniſtred, cordialls of pearle, Saphires, and rubies, with ſuch like, recomforte the heart throwne downe, &amp; appaled with fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall feare. In this affliction, the perill is not

The cauſe here is the ſeuerity of Gods iudgement, ſummoning the guilty conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: the ſubiect is the ſinnefull ſoule apprehending the terror thereof, which is not momentary or for a ſeaſon, but for euer and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: the iſſue of this affliction is eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſatisfactory to the iuſtice of the eternall God, which is endleſſe, and whoſe ſeuerity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no mediation, neither that extended to one ioynte, ſinue or vaine, but to all, neither that of the body only, but of the ſoule, whoſe nature, as it is impatible of all other thinges, and of all other thinges in greateſt peace, aſſurance and tranquillitye, ſo once ſhaken by the terrours of Gods wrath, and blaſted with that whirlewinde of his diſpleaſure, falleth and with it driueth the whole frame of our nature into extreame miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vtter confuſion: ſo farre they are abuſed who iudge theſe caſes as naturall, and ſuch is the calamity of thoſe whom the prophane ones of this world propound vnto themſelues as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſcoffe and deriſion, laboring by al meanes to benumme the ſenſe of that ſtinge, which ſinne
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6813:108"/>euer carrieth in the tayle, what pretence ſo euer it ſheweth of right, profit or pleaſure, in face of outward appearance, to delude the foole &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his wayes, skillfull to do euill, ſottiſh in the pathes of righteouſnes, and vtterly ignorant of her rule, and wherein nature giueth ſome ſparke of light, more diſtinctly to diſcerne, euen there with corruption of affection, like to ſtubburne &amp; vnbroaken horſe, ſhaketh of reaſon, diſpiſeth her manage, and layeth the noble ryder in the duſt. In reſpect of you my deare <hi>M.</hi> I know this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe were ſuperfluous, who ſtandeth in neede of ſalue to the ſore, and beareth not the leaſt touch of this gale, but becauſe my purpoſe in this labour is not only to informe and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte you, but alſo for the inſtruction of others, beare with this, and paſſe it ouer, as not belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto you, but to the foole: of whome Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeaketh, that followeth wickednes like an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a foole to the ſtockes for correction, and as a bird ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that he is in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Touching your particular eſtate, that you may iudge thereof more ſincerely, you are to eſteeme of it, as mixed of the melancholick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and that terror of God: which as it is vpon the wicked an entrance into their eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo vnto you, it is, (as I ſhall hereafter at large make proofe) a fatherly frowning only for a time, to correct that which in you is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and an admonition of farther circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection in your wayes and courſe of life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. For the firſt pointe you may remember
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6813:109"/>your ſwolne ſplene, with windnes and hardenes vnder the left ribbes, the hemeroydes not flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to their vſuall manner, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and groſſenes of that blood which hath ben taken from you vpon occaſion, your dreames or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fearefull, your ſolitarines and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſadnes, with almoſt all kinde of accidentes which accompanie melancholy. For the other part whereof moſt you complaine, the manner leadeth me to iudge thereof otherwiſe then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, both becauſe ſuch is indeede the feare &amp; terror of God ſent vpon man, and no effect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature or cauſe beſides: as alſo becauſe the obiect or mouing cauſe is, in reaſon and cleare vnderſtanding, voide of all abuſe of fancy, ſuch as of neceſſity inforceth theſe lamentable effects which your ſoule feeleth &amp; deſireth the releaſe of, vpon you the croſſe falleth more heauily, in ſo much as you are vnder the diſaduantage of the melancholicke complexion: whoſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Sathan embraceth to vrge all terror againſt you to the fall. But remember that he who hath redeemed vs, paſſed vnder theſe feares &amp; hath ſanctified them to his redeemed, and according to his example, who was heard in that which he feared, when in the dayes of his fleſh he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp prayers and ſupplications with ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teares vnto him that was able to ſaue him from death: ſo follow him in hope and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who hath obtained the victory not for him ſelfe onely, but for all ſuch as in like temptation depend vpon him. To the end my labour may giue you a more perfect direction in this heauy
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6813:109"/>caſe, what is naturall, and what is according to the good pleaſure of God in the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe aboue nature, I will make particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of both in the Chapter following, to your clearer vnderſtanding.</p>

               <p>VVHatſoeuer moleſtation riſeth directly as a proper obiect of the mind, that in that reſpect is not melancholicke, but hath a farther ground then fancie, and riſeth from conſcience, condemning the guiltie ſoule of thoſe ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen lawes of nature, which no man is voide of, be he neuer ſo laborous. This is it, that hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the prophane poëts to haue fained Hecates Eumenides, and the infernall furies; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be but fained perſons, yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is ſhewed vnder their maske, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, true, and of wofull experience. This ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing of the body, nor intermedleth with humour, but giueth a direct wounde with thoſe firie dartes, which men ſo afflicted make their mone of. Of this kinde Saule was poſſeſſed, to whom the Lord ſent an euill ſpirite to encreaſe the torment; and Iudas the traytor, who tooke the reuenge of betraying the innocent vppon him ſelfe with his owne handes; ſuch was the anguiſh that Eſau felte when he found no repentance, after he had ſold his birthright for a meſſe of pottage; and ſuch is the eſtate of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:6813:110"/>all defiled conſciences with hainous crimes; whoſe harts are neuer free from that worme, but with deadly bite thereof are driuen to diſpaire. Theſe terrible obiectes which properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the minde, are ſuch as onely affect it with horror of Gods iuſtice for breach of thoſe lawes naturall, or written in his word, which by duty of creation, we are holden to obey. For the minde as it is impatible of anie thing but of God onely that made it, ſo ſtandeth it in awe of none but of him, neither admitteth it any other violence then from him, into whoſe handes it is moſt terrible and fearefull to fall. This cauſeth ſuch diſtreſſe vnto thoſe that feele the torment hereof, that they would redeeme it gladly, if it were poſſible with anie other kind, yea mith ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering all other kind of miſerie. This hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vnto the wiſeſt among men while the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of their vnderſtanding hath ſtood ſound; it taketh of a ſodaine like lightning, and giueth no warning. Here the puririe of the bloud, and the ſinceritie and liuelineſſe of the ſpirits auayle nothing to mitigate the paine, but onely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatorie ſacrifice of the vnſpotted lambe. On the contrarie part, when anie conceit troubleth you that hath no ſufficient grounde of reaſon, but riſeth onely vpon the frame of your brayne, which is ſubiect (as hath bene before ſhewed) vnto the humour, that is right melancholicke, &amp; ſo to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted of you. Theſe are falſe points of reaſon deceaued by the melancholie braine, and diſguiſed ſcarres of the heart, without abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to worke the pretenced annoyaunce: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:6813:110"/>do they approch the ſubſtaunce, and the ſubſtantiall and ſoueraigne actions of the ſoule, as the other doeth. This eſtate happeneth by degrees, and getteth ſtrength in time, to the encumbrance of all the inſtrumentall actions, and driue the braine into a ſottiſhneſſe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the cleare light of reaſon. Here the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour purged, and the ſpirite attenuate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with remedie conuenient, the brayne ſtrengthened, and the hart comforted with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall, are meanes moſt excellent ordayned of God for this infirmitie. And to deliuer you in a word the difference, whatſoeuer is beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinne in this caſe, it is melancholie: which conſcience terrified, is of ſuch nature, ſo beſet with infinite feares and diſtruſt, that it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie waſteth the pure ſpirit, congeleth the liuely bloud, and ſtriketh our nature in ſuch ſort, that it ſoone becommeth melancholicke, vile and baſe, and turneth reaſon into fooliſhneſſe, and diſgraceth the beautie of the countenance, and tranfor meth the ſtouteſt Nabucadnezar in the world into a brute beaſt; ſo eaſily is the body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to alteration of minde, &amp; ſoone looſeth with anguiſh and diſtruction thereof, all the ſupport of his excellencie. Beſides this in you, vaine feares, and falſe conceits of apparitions, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a voyce ſounding in your eares, fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dreames, diſtruſt of the conſumption, and putrifying of one part or other of your bodie, &amp; the reſt of this crue, are cauſes of moleſtation, which are whelpes of that melancholicke litter, &amp; are bred of the corrupted ſtate of the body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:6813:111"/>altered in ſpirit, in bloud, in ſubſtance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, by the aboundance of this ſettling of the bloud, which we call melancholie. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the terrour of the afflicted minde, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the feare &amp; diſcouragement, &amp; ſhutteth vp the meanes of conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is after another ſort to be conueyed to the minde, then the way which the temptation taketh to breed diſtruſt of Gods mercy, &amp; pardon. For that hath ſinne the meanes, which needeth no conueyaunce, but is bred with vs, &amp; entreth euen into our conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: neither is the guiltineſſe brought vnto vs by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine report, but the knowledge riſeth from the conſcience of the offender: the meanes (I meane the outwarde meanes of conſolation and cure) muſt needs paſſe by our ſenſes to enter the mind whoſe inſtrument being altred by the humor, &amp; their ſincerity ſtained with the obſcure and dark ſpots of melancholy, receiue not indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the medicine of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So it both miſtaketh, that which it apprehendeth, and deliuereth it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to the minds conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As their brains are thus euill diſpoſed, ſo their harts in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, &amp; acquainted with terror, &amp; ouertbrown with that fearful paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hardly ſet free the cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpirits, feebled with the corporall priſon of the body, &amp; hardly yeeld to perſuaſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort what ſoeuer it bringeth of aſſurance. This cauſeth the releaſe of the affliction to be long &amp; hard, and not anſwerable to the ſwiftneſſe of the procuring cauſe, hauing ſo many wayes top aſſe, &amp; encountring ſo many lets before it meet with the ſore. For as the cauſe reſpecteth not time nor
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:6813:111"/>place, no circumſtance of perſon, nor condition, ſeeketh no opportunity of corporall imbecillity, but breakeath through all ſuch conſiderations, &amp; beareth downe all reſiſtance: ſo the comfort requireth them all agreable, &amp; miſſing any one, worketh feble effects, &amp; ſlow. Here the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forters perſon, his maner, the time, &amp; place, may hinder the conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: here the braine &amp; hart, being as it were the gates &amp; entraunce vnto the ſoule, as they be affected, ayd, or hinder the conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſo that the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce diſtreſſed falling into a mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtate of body, therby receiueth delay of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring in reſpect of outward meanes; though the grace of God, &amp; his mercy, his comfortable ſpirit, &amp; gracious fauor in like ſwiftneſſe without meanes may reſtore the minde thus diſtreſſed: which lieth equally open to the kind of cure, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it lay to the wound. Thus I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this point of difference, &amp; marke betwixt melancholy and the ſoules proper anguiſh, whoſe only cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from Gods vengeance &amp; wrath appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of the guilty ſoule: neither doth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly alone, (though it may hinder the outward meanes of conſolation, as it hath bin before ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) any thing make men more ſubiect vnto this kind of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt becauſe the body worketh nothing vpon the ſoule altogether impatible of any other ſauing of God alone. 2. The torment is ſuch as riſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an efficient that requireth no diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of means; God himſelf. 3. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort is not procured by any corporal inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort procured or increaſed that way; moreouer the cauſe, the ſubiect, the proper
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:6813:112"/>effects are other then corporall. For although in that caſe the hart is heauy, deliuering a paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwerable to the fearfull apprehenſion, yet the ſenſe of thoſe that are vnder this croſſe feele an anguiſh farre beyond all afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of naturall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion coupled with that organicall feare and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe of heart. The melancholy diſpoſeth to feare, doubt, diſtruſt, &amp; heauineſſe, but all either without cauſe, or where there is cauſe aboue it inforceth the paſſion. Here both the moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cauſe vrgeth, and alwayes carieth a paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therwith aboue the harts affection, euen the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of thoſe torments, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued at full, as our nature now ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, nor deliuered by report. Here in this paſſion, the cauſe is not feare nor paſſionate griefe, but a torment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing theſe affections: and euen as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bodily racking is not the paſſion of the hart, but cauſeth it only; ſo the hart fareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſore of the mind, which here properlie fretteth and ſtraineth the ſinnes of the ſoule, wherefrom the heart taketh his grieuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and fainteth vnder Gods iuſtice. Hitherto you haue deſcribed that which your ſoule feeleth, not to inſtruct you, but that other may more truly iudge of the caſe, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt melancholy &amp; it, may be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:6813:112"/>and being culpable of the breach of God lawes, incurre the puniſhment of condemnation: yet is the melancholicke perſon more then any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect therunto: not that the humor hath ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which hath before bin declared to ſtand far a loofe of ſuch effect, but by reaſon the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke perſon is moſt doubtfull, &amp; iclous of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, not only of this life, but alſo of the life to come; this maketh him fall into debate with him ſelfe, &amp; to be more then curious; who finding his actions not fitting the naturall, or written line of righteouſneſſe, &amp; wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting that archpiller of faith &amp; aſſurance in Chriſt Ieſus our hope, partly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough feare findeth the horror, and partly (if it pleaſe God ſo far to touch) feeleth the verie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh due vnto the ſinner, &amp; in that moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition falleth into flat diſpaire. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, when the curious melancholy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the minde into the ſenſes of ſuch miſteries as exceed humayne capacity, and is deſirous to know more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is reuealed in the word of truth: or being ignorant of that which is reuealed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough importunate inquirie, of a ſudden falleth into that gulfe of Gods ſecret counſelles which ſwalloweth vp all conceit of man or angell: and meaſuring the trueth of ſuch depth of miſteries by the ſhallow modill of his owne wit, is caught &amp; deuoured of that which his preſumptuous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie moued him to attempt to apprehend. Of melancholy perſons, eſpecially ſuch as are moſt contemplatiue, except they be well grounded in the word of God, &amp; remoue not one haire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from in their ſpeculations, are this wayes moſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:6813:113"/>ouertaken, &amp; receaue the puniſhment of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of thoſe holy things, which the Lord hath reſerued to his owne counſell: while they neglect the declared truth, propounded for rule of life and practiſe, in written wordes reuealed; not remembring the exhortation of Moyſes to the children of Iſraell: the ſecrets are the Lords but the reuealed will, appertaineth to vs, &amp; our children. And this in mine opinion is one cauſe wherefore melancholicke perſonnes are more prone to fall into this pitte, then ſuch as are in their organicall members otherwiſe affected. Nowe contemplations are more familiar with melancholicke perſons then with other, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they be not ſo apt for action, conſiſting alſo of a temper ſtill and ſlowe according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the melancholie humour, which if it be attenuated with heate, deliuereth a drie, ſubtile and pearcing ſpirite, more conſtant and ſtable then anie other humour, which is a great helpe to this contemplation. As the melancholicke is moſt ſubiect to the calamitie before mentioned, and eſpecially the contemplatiue, ſo of them moſt of all, ſuch whoſe vocation conſiſteth in ſtudie of hard pointes of learning, and that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall (eſpecially of Nature) haue cauſe in this caſe to carie a lowe ſaile, and ſometime to ſtrike, and lay at the anker of the Scriptures of God, leſt by tempeſt of their preſumption, they be caried into that whirle poole, whereout they be in daunger (without the eſpeciall grace of Gods mercie) neuer to deliuer them ſelues. Such except they be well ballaced with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6813:113"/>of the Scriptures, and aſſurance of Gods ſpirite, are neuer able to abide the ouglineſſe of their ſinnes, when they ſhall be once vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the narrowe point of reprobration and clection propounded vnto their melancholicke braines and hearts, and moſt miſerale polluted ſoules: vnacquainted with Gods couenaunt of mercie, and that earneſt of his fauour, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſpirit of his grace. Of ſuch as haue ſome knowledge in the worde, and practiſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the want of the true apprehending of gods reuealed wil touching election and reprobation, and the right method of learning &amp; conceauing the doctrine, cauſeth ſome to ſtumble, and fall at this ſtone. For as a ſworde taken at the wrong end is readie to wound the hand of the taker, &amp; held by the handle is a fit weapon of defence; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the doctrine of predeſtination being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly conceiued, may through fault of the conceiuer procure hurt; whereas of it ſelfe it is the moſt ſtrong rocke of aſſurance, in all ſtormes of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations that can befall vnto bodie or ſoule. The one part of predeſtination, is Gods immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table will, the cauſe and rule of all iuſtice, and vttermoſt of all reaſon in his workes: the other part is the execution of that will, according to mercie or iuſtice, ſauing or condemning, with all the meanes thereto belonging: Chriſt Ieſus in thoſe of whom the Lorde will ſhewe mercie, and the iuſt deſert of a ſinner on whome he is determined to ſhewe the iuſtice of his wrath. If this moſt comfortable doctrine, and the firme ancher of our profeſſion be not in all partes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6813:114"/>equally apprehended, we may not onely miſſe the benefite therof through our owne fault, but receiue wounde and daungerous hurte thereby. For if the conſideration be bent vpon Gods will and counſel only, without reſpect of the means, it is impoſſible but the frailty of mans nature muſt needes be diſtracted into diuerſe perilous and deſperate feares, finding nothing in it ſelfe that may anſwere his iuſtice, and withſtand the fearefull ſentence of condemnation: if it ſtay in the meanes of his iuſtice only, and haue not eye vpon his mercy in his ſonne Chriſt, then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ariſeth an aſſurance of eternall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce defiled, and the guilty ſoule deformed with iniquity: if the meanes of his mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy be regarded without farther reſpect of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decree and immouable iuſtice, then is there alſo no aſſurance of his mercy vnto miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, who melteth like ſnow and vaniſheth like a vapour before his iuſtice, and doubting of the continuance of his fauour alwayes hangeth in ſuſpence. All theſe conſiderations thus ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally falling into the melancholick perſon, moue doubt and care, and either breed a reſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratnes, or a continuall diſtruſt, toſſing hither and thither the ſoule not eſtabliſhed by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith in Gods eternall counſell, &amp; the moſt wiſe, iuſt and mercifull meanes of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: which being perfectly knowne according to the word, and ſealed vp in the chriſtian heart by the worke of Gods ſpirite, is ſo farre of from diſquieting the ſpirit or breeding doubt, that the children of God in all temptations finde the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6813:114"/>mutability of Gods counſell, and the teſtimony of his fauour in their conſciences by his ſpirite, to ſupporte them in all ſtormes of temptation, and to be the rocke againſt which no violence of Sathan, or his miniſters, or whatſoeuer their owne infirmity offereth of diſcouragement can preuaile. Beſides theſe, ſuch as read the word of God with paſſionate humour, fall into this inconuenience: eſpecially if without guide and inſtruction they carie any preſumption of minde and are not modeſt and warie in their collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch being melancholicke may eaſily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſtruſt of Gods mercy, &amp; periſh in diſpaire. So that ignorance and infidelity, are the chiefe cauſes of this miſerable eſtate: whereinto many haue fallen, eſpecially ſuch as haue neuer bene able to be recomforted, which for the moſt part are they who with neglect of Godds feare and hardnes of heart, againſt their conſcience and knowledge, haue with deſperate purpoſe gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtrength in the wayes of ſinne, and haue caſt of all remorſe, til the Lordes vengeaunce in this ſort ouertake them, or haue fallen into that ſinn whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, that none ſhould pray for, and which our Sauiour calleth the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. Other ſome ther be (of which number I know you deare <hi>M.</hi>) that fearing the Lord with ſincerity of hearte, haue bene notwithſtanding this way diſtreſſed, the weight of their ſinnes exceeding for a time the ſtrength of their faith, whoſe caſe I take to be thus farre, other then ſuch as I haue before mentioned: euen as in ſtormie tempeſt the ſhip
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:6813:115"/>ſtirreth at euery blaſt and ſourge of the ſea to be in daunger of wrack, and the yong aſh bending to euery blaſt of winde, ſeemeth in perill of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; rooting vp, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both the ſhip kepeth her conſtant courſe, &amp; the tree yet hath his rooting; ſo in you, &amp; thoſe of your diſpoſition in this caſe, the tempeſt, and ſtorme of this temptation, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed partly by your owne weakenes, and partely through Sathans tempeſtious malice: cauſeth your faith to bend, and ſeeme feeble, &amp; yeelding to this force, while notwithſtanding you be built on the rocke, &amp; planted with the hand of God in the Eden of his gracious election, &amp; remayne a plante for euer in his paradiſe of eternall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Such (as you your ſelf) herm offend, that you meaſure your ſelues by your infirmities, which hath ſo farre vſe in vs to breed a watchfull care ouer our owne wayes, &amp; not to diſcourage vs: &amp; conſider that we are as the Lord eſteemeth, who is more glorified in ſhewing mercie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in executing of his wrath: whoſe word declareth vnto vs, that he loued vs being ennemies, and found vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were loſt, and loathed not our polution, but for himſelfe onely offered his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: ſo that we muſt ſtand in that reckning of our ſelues which the Lord will haue vs to doe in his mercie: elſe ſhal we be wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g iudges of the wayes of the Almighty. Euen as one that hath not had experience of trauaile by ſea, feareth euery wea uing of the ſhip, &amp; doubteth of perill, where the nature of the trauailer is ſuch without hazard or daunger; So you, &amp; ſuch as are in like caſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, imagine euery puffe of this kinde of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6813:115"/>to be nothing elſe but the gate of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when as notwithſtanding it is the verie courſe &amp; way where through God doth lead his deareſt children: whoſe counſells are not to be meaſured, by our infirmities, nor by that we caſt, forecaſt, or doubt, but as he himſelfe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced of his own wayes, &amp; as many of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue proued before vs. Here the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie taketh aduantage and Sathan proſecuteth a maine, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding your affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to feare, doubt, &amp; diſtruſt, ſtoppeth that conſolation the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of god affordeth, &amp; which his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to miniſter vnto you. And theſe are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholickes of another ſort; who notwithſtanding they endeuour to feare God, yet not aduiſed, through this baſe &amp; vile humor, receiue diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more then (through Gods mercie) they haue need, til ſuch time as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Theſe are mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choliks moſt diſpoſed, by reaſon of the euill temper of their bodies to this affliction, not by power of the humor, which reſteth in their bodies, &amp; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not the minde, but by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are more curious &amp; diſtruſtfull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: which being ioyned with ignorance, or a prepoſterous knowledge caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into theſe laberinthes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rituall ſorow, whereout very hardly are they at the length able to diſpatch themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great mercy of God, and diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full applying of his meanes. But you may ſay vnto me, can a man by his owne power drawe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6813:116"/>on this kinde of croſſe, which you haue before declared to be the hand of God? yea verily, if Gods only mercie be not his ſtay, euen as our firſt parents voluntarily gaue their neckes, and in them all their poſterity vnder the yoke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: and as the vengeance of Gods iuſtice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes burneth againſt the wicked, &amp; his ſword continually employed, which nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch but the water of his grace flowing from the ſids of his Sonne, and that ſpiritual complet armour where of S. Paul ſpeaketh of: ſo ſhould euen all of vs in this life taſte of the heate, &amp; feele the dint of that ſword, if his mercy in his Sonne &amp; for his Saintes cauſe on the earth, he ſtaied not the ielouſie of his wrath: His anger our ſinnes pull on, but his mercy is only for himſelfe. Thus you haue heard what manner affliction this of the minde and conſcience of ſinne, not comforted by aſſurance of pardon is, how it differeth from melancholy, how melancholicke perſons are moſt ſubiect therunto, and by what meanes this calamity is procured, with the diuerſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus afflicted: hereafter you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (which is your chiefe deſire) my counſell and cure, both in that ſtate of minde wherin you ſtand, and whereof the Lord graunt you ſpeedy and comfortable releaſe, and alſo in what your craſed body ſurgayned with melancholy and all his vncomfortable accidentes doth of naturall &amp; phiſick help of medicine require. But firſt my deare M. giue way to my wordes of comfort, and for the old friendſhips ſake, and ſweete ſociety we haue had in times paſt, alwayes ſeaſoned

               <p>YOu feele (you ſay) the wrath of God kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled againſt your ſoule, and anguiſh of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience moſt intollerable, and can finde (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding continuail prayers and inceſſaunt ſupplication made vnto the Lord) no releaſe, &amp; in your owne iudgement ſtand reprobate from Gods couenant, and voide of all hope of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, expecting the conſummation of your miſery and fearefull ſentence of eternall conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I pray you (deare brother) conſider Gods mercies of old, and the former experience of his fauour, and thoſe holy teſtimonies of election which you haue in times paſt made plentifully ſhew of, and conſider whether it be not rather a temptation, then as you imagine, Gods anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you. Of temptations there are diuerſe ſortes, ſome riſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our owne natures, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome from without vs: ſuch as are without our natures, either ſpringe from our malitious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Sathan, or from ſuch allurementes, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which the world toſſeth vs withall: In theſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6813:117"/>Sathan is a worker, beſides his owne peculiar manner of tempting. His temptations are either by corporall poſſeſſion, or with more liberty and freedome to the tempted. Of our owne natures ſpringe the temptations which riſe of the roote of originall ſinne, without any forraine inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the world, whatſoeuer is either a bayte of pleaſure, or fright of terror, which increaſe the actuall ſinnes ſpringing from the originall roote, and lay as it were compaſſe, and powreth on water, to that vngracious ſtock. Now if this your affliction be no other, but ſome kinde of theſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (which I haue no doubt to make manifeſt and playne vnto you) then are you to eſteeme of your caſe more comfortably the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you do, and to attend with patience the iſſue, which not onely is not infallible to ſignifie determinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of election or reprobation, but in ſuch as are of like conuerſation vnto you, and haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen euident teſtimonies of a ſound faith grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge, as you haue done, bringeth forth the fruites of patience, experience, hope, increaſe of faith, and not onely in the end yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth plenty of ſpirituall ioy, and comforte vnto themſelues, but furniſheth alſo with power, and hability to confirme others, both by their owne example, and wordes of great conſolation from their owne experience. In all the former kindes of temptations, there is hope, and examples are ſundry in ech kinde: of which the corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting of Sathan is the greateſt, fulleſt of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and diſpaire: yet the hiſtory of the deedes and ſayinges of Chriſt, the wrytinges of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6813:117"/>do teſtifie of whole legions diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of that habitation, by the power of Chriſt mercifully extended vpon ſuch poore and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable captiues; which examples are written for our inſtruction againſt like times of affliction, that we giue not ouer hope, though millions of deuills ſhould poſſeſſe vs within, and enuirone vs without; but knowe his power is aboue all force of the enemie, and his mercie farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting Sathans malice. But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in this particular, I will make plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration vnto you, that you haue no cauſe in this ſorte to feare, nor haue anie ſhadowe of grounde whereon you ſhould reſolue againſt your ſelfe vppon the poynt of reprobation, but that theſe moleſtations and terrours, which you nowe indure are temptations, rather for your farther good and profite, then grounded reſolutions, of ſuch lamentable iſſue: which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing declared vnto you in the generalitie, I will enter into the particular kindes, wherewith I iudge you are thus diſtreſſed. Firſt I will ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to looſe the holde your melancholie hath layed vppon the aſſuraunce (as you take it) of reprobation; which hauing firſt perfourmed, your iudgement may more eaſilie embrace the other parte, which is a tryall onely for a time, and a meere temptation. Although Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren euerie one haue their ſaluation founded vppon his eternall decree of mercie towardes them, publiſhed by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and written, and ſealed in the heart of his choſen, by the power of the ſpirite of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6813:118"/>which crieth Abba, father, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in meaſure, ſome more &amp; ſome leſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that grace; yet on the contrarie part, there is no euident and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſigne of reprobation in any, while they liue: (becauſe there may be hope of repentance) but onely that ſinne, which Chriſt calleth the ſinne againſt the holie Ghoſt, and for which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle forbiddeth to pray: this the Diuines do expound to be an open &amp; wilfull apoſtaſie from God, with malitious hate againſt the profeſſion of his knowen trueth. Next vnto this ſinne, is impenitencie: which can not be knowne, till death make ſhewe thereof, and cut of time of repentance. Of the firſt of theſe, examples are verie rare, as Iulianus the Emperour called apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata: of the other, Cain, Eſau, Saul, Iudas, and the prophane people of the world that know not Chriſt, and ſuch as knowe him onely in vaine profeſſion outwardly, and ſo continue, are pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of the ſinne, and ſhall be examples of Gods vengeance. But firſt touching that ſinne, wherefore no prayer is to be made, (becauſe it witneſſeth, and ſealeth vp reprobation to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender in this life) I will by comparinge your courſe of life, and your preſent demeanour with that ſinne, manifeſtly lay open your caſe to be farre other then reprobate. Before I enter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, you muſt beware you make no mo ſinnes of that kind, then God him ſelfe hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be of that ſort: for in theſe matters that concerne Gods religion, euen the perfection of our wiſedome is but follie, much more our ſicke
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6813:118"/>braines, and melancholicke vnderſtanding, is farre to be remoued from handling ſuch holie thinges, whereof none can geue rule, but he who knoweth the perfect nature, (as I may ſo ſpeake) of God, which is knowen onely to him ſelfe; ſo that here you muſt reſt in this caſe, and ſtriue to ſee with no ſharper eye, then ſo farre as God hath reuealed; nor enter other courſe in ſearch of ſuch matters of his ſecreſie, then he hath him ſelfe manifeſted: by whoſe Oracles we are inſtructed, that only one kinde of ſinne cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of all hope of ſaluation in ſuch as haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt, and that only becauſe it is of ſuch nature, that it cloſeth vp all remorſe of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce: being the height of all iniquitie, equall with that of the deuilles them ſelues, who are ſhut out of Gods fauour for euer. If this then be the onely ſinne which brandeth the wicked ſoule to eternall condemnation, and you (deare heart) haue not in anie ſort thus offended, (as I haue no doubt to make euident proofe) whie do you vnkindlie torment your owne heart, and throwe your ſelfe into that pit of deſtruction, from which the Lord hath redeemed you? and as though you were your owne and not his, a poſſeſſion of your own purchaſe to be beſtowed as fancie leadeth you, and not Gods creation, wrought by his ſpirite of regeneration, orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his ſeruice and glorie. Nowe let vs enter into the conſideration, whether you haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the holie Ghoſt or not: which if you haue in deede done (as peraduenture your humour would leade you) where is the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6813:119"/>of Gods religion, which you haue hitherto profeſſed and preſently do hartely embrace? Where is that malice, which proſecuteth this miſchiefe? What perſecution haue you in word or deede raiſed againſt the truth? What ſword haue you euer drawne againſt it, or what vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes haue you written againſt ſound doctrine, with purpoſed oppoſition againſt your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, neither that of frailtie, but of meere will and obſtinacie? If your humour be not able to alleadge ſuch teſtimonies, (as it cannot in deed, theſe thinges being matters of iudgement and will, and not of fancie, and conſiſting of euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be knowen of others, and not of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie conceit of a fearful and diſtruſtfull hart) giue ouer I pray you theſe melancholicke priudices againſt your ſelfe, and prepare your heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue comfort, which the word of promiſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth vnto you. For that ſinne except onely, all other are within compaſſe of grace, and haue no power to ſhut vs from Gods fauour. Be it that you haue ſinned againſt your conſcience; yet certaine, condemnation and caſting of, doth not neceſſarily enſue thereupon; elſe ſhould there be not a perſon on whome God ſhould ſhewe mercie. For we all ſinne in that manner, and the good we would (our conſcience bearing witneſſe of our duetie, and breach of that we are bounde to do) we do not; but the ſinne which we would not do in reſpect of regeneration, that we commit through our frailtie, which groweth vp in ſtrenghth, by increaſes of God to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and hath euermore in it not to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6813:119"/>vs, but to breede circumſpection, and to remember vs where our perfection and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie lieth, euen without vs, in that vnſpotted lambe Chriſt Ieſus. For our willes are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not onely in that they are ſeduced by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt iudgement, which is the leaſt part of their want; but when contrarie to iudgement groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either vppon nature, or the plaine worde of trueth, we make choyce of that we knowe is naught, or preferre the greater euill before the leſſe. Otherwiſe ſhould our nature obtaine in this life a greater perfection, then our firſt parentes had in paradice, whoſe freedome of will was peruerted to that, which was againſt the knowen commaundement of God: and giue any one faculty or practiſe of the minde be perfect, all muſt needs be of like pureneſſe; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equallie they were corrupted, and equallie receaue reſtauration. This perfection we are to hope for, and attende the conſummation of the rudimentes of righteouſneſſe, which both in knowledge and vſe are in part blind and impotent, and in heauen are to receaue the abſolute perfection and beautie, fully agreeable to Gods good will and vprightneſſe of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. If then you haue neither ſinned againſt the holie Ghoſt, which is plaine through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold teſtimonies of vnfaigned faith, euen at this time being full of ſighes and groanes for your offences, carefull to eſchue what ſoeuer is repugnaunt to Gods will, releeuinge with tender affection of Chriſtian loue the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of others; neither in the whole courſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6813:120"/>of your life, hauing bene of notorious marke of iniquitie, much leſſe a blaſphemer of that holie name, and a renouncer, with contumelie of the holie profeſſion: aſſure your ſelfe that your preſent eſtate is no other, but a ſtorme of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and no marke of perdition) from which the Lorde, (after triall of faith and patience) will deliuer you, and ſende that calme peace and tranquillitie, which in times paſt you haue enioyed, and ſhall by his grace againe recouer, to your euerlaſting comfort. Of temptations ſome touch our fayth, and other ſome the fruites thereof. Our faith; as whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue or not. The fruites: either of profeſſion of the truth, when perſecution or feare, or fauour of men, ſlaken our zeale, and ſmother the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhewe of thoſe glorious graces of faith, &amp; of the ſpirite, or in the fruites of obedience ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and kindly vnto our profeſſion, as thoſe which concerne perſons, poſſeſſions, or name, wherein charitie towarde men is broken: all theſe temptations, though both affection do incline vnto them, (excepting incredulitie, which bringeth foorth impenitencie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the faith) and will bring them to effect, yet are they not of power to ſeparate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt, whoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is all ſufficient, and propitiatorie for all kindes of ſinne, (that onely before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned excepted.) You ſay you beleeue not, and therefore drawe vppon you the payne due to the vnfaithfull: here beware deare brother, and waigh with circumſpectipn, and due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:6813:120"/>of your ſtate in ſo waightie a point as this is, and although you haue not at this time the ſenſe thereof in your imagination, which is now diſguiſed and blemiſhed with melancholie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and corporall alteration of the inſtrument of the bodie, yet do you beleeue, and ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after feele the ſweete comfort thereof, as you nowe aboundantly declare the fruites of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a roote; patience, meekneſſe, charity, prayer, newneſſe of life, and what ſoeuer good vertue ſpringeth in the children of God therefrom. For euen as in outwarde ſenſes we do ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and feele, and heare; when wee do not perceaue it, ſo we may alſo haue faith, and not alwayes haue the ſenſible perceauing thereof; eſpeciallie our bodies (as yours preſently is) being oppreſſed with melancholie, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vrgeth terror and diſtruſt: and deludeth vs with opinion of want of that, whereof wee haue no lacke: euen as in another extremitie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are oft carried with an opinion and confidence of thoſe thinges whereof they haue no part. And if it be ſo with melancholickes, (as it is crediblie recorded in hiſtorie) that ſome haue complained they haue bene headleſſe, ſo that (as Aëtius reporteth) Phylotymus the Phiſitian was faine to put a cap of lead, vpon a melancholickes heade, that he might by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the waight conceaue otherwiſe; and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midorus the Grammarian did imagine he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both a hand and a legge, though he wanted neither, you are to lay aſide this fancie, and to weigh the preſence of the cauſe by the effectes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:6813:121"/>which are moſt euident tokens of faith in you, and not to reſt vppon your deluded conceites, which if you yeeld vnto, will perſwade you in the ende, that you want both head and heart alſo, after it hath diſpoſſeſſed you in part of the right vſe of both: but you will ſay vnto me, do not men otherwiſe doubt of this point but vpon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie? Yes verely: and eſpecially ſuch as moſt hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, and are poore in ſpirit, and broken in hart: the reſt of the world, (except ſome vengeance of God laye holde vppon them, or ſome horrible fact gnawe their wounded conſcience,) paſſing their time in a blinde ſecuritie, careleſſe of God, and emptie of all ſenſe and hope of a better life, or feare of that eternall deſtruction; paſſe their dayes, and finiſh their courſe, as the calfe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the ſhambles not knowing their ende to be ſlaughter by the butchers knife. Such I ſaye as are moſt carefull to walke before their God in righteouſneſſe, as they doubt and feare in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie action, leſt God be diſhonoured by their conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo are they ielouſe of their pretious faith, leſt it be not in ſuch meaſure as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, or in truth be none at all: wherein they may eaſily be deceaued; firſt in the diſcerning, then in the meaſure and portion. Touching the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thus may they be ouertaken: when the inward feeling thereof doth not aunſwere their deſire, and the actions proceeding therfrom do not ſatisfie their thirſt of righteouſneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reliefe may riſe to the nouriſhment of faith, &amp; the ſatisfying of that holy appetite; they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:6813:121"/>and entangled with ſpirituall cares, from which a more aduiſed conſideration agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods worde might eaſily deliuer them. Touching the portion, their fault lyeth in this, that they meaſure the excellencie thereof and the power, partly by meaſure, and quantitie, and not by vertue, wherewith through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull grace it is indued to the ſaluation of all thoſe that haue it but in meaſure of a graine of muſtard ſeede: which both errours are to be corrected, by pondering of the caſe, not by that we iudge, but by that God him ſelfe hath geuen rule of: both touching the ſenſe of faith, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of the fruites, and increaſe of meaſure: all being his giftes and graces diſpenced vnto vs, according to his mercie and wiſedome, as is moſt for his glorie, and expedient for vs. For if we duly weigh from whence we are fallen, and howe deepe into this degenerate nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are captiues of Sathan, and ſlaues of all iniquitie, we ſhall receaue comfort of the leaſt ſparke of faith, and may praiſe God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue comfort in the ſmalleſt worke of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience perfourmed in ſinceritie, though not in perfection: and if we finde the increaſes ſlowe, and the victorie harde in this our warfare: let vs conſider with whome we fight, and for what crowne: and howe both heauen and earth was moued at our redemptiion: and the ſame power concurred thereto, as in our firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as the great and mightie oakes are ſlower in attaining their full grouth, then ſhrubs and weedes, whoſe enduring is for many ages,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6813:122"/>when the other in ſhort time wither and fadde away, ſo eſteeme your encreaſe of heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſlow, but ſure, euerlaſting as immortalitye, that you may be as a beame or a piller in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God for euer and euer. Neither are we to accompt the nature of any thing according to our ſenſe or to the ſhew it maketh. For then ſhould the moſt fruitefull tree in winter be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for barren, and the luſtie ſoile dry, and vnfruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full while it is ſhut vp with the hard froſt: but rea ſon (as in other deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) ſo in this muſt lead vs (being guided by the word of God) rightly to iudge of the preſence, &amp; life of faith in our ſouls: which being the ſhield in this our ſpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, endureth much battering &amp; many bruntes and receiueth the forefront of the encounter, &amp; oft times faireth as if it were pearced through and worne, vnfit for battaile: yet is it in deede of nature inuincible, and repelleth whatſoeuer ingine the enimy inforceth againſt vs, and ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firme rooted: whatſoeuer ſtorme Sathan raiſeth for the diſplacing thereof. How then are we to behaue our ſelues in this temptation: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both the ſence of faith is dulled in vs, and the fruites miniſter diſcontentment? you remember the ſaying of the Apoſtle, the graces and mercy of God is without repentance, and Chriſt Ieſus whome he loueth, to the end he loueth them: if then you haue in times paſt felt that gift of the ſpirit, (which you haue done) &amp; haue ioyed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: be aſſured it is a marke neuer to be defaced, of your election &amp; firme ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in Gods fauour. For what moued the Lord to beſtow the grace:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6813:122"/>but his owne mercy: &amp; that he beſtoweth: who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take away if he himſelf take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, for ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte of ours, did not he foreſee the ſame lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? &amp; ſo why did he not withold his mercy? but as he knew vs when we were ſtraungers from him, and loued vs, when we hated him, and had nothing which might prouoke his mercy, but our miſery: ſo is his goodnes continued vpon vs ſtill for his owne ſake, and not at all for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing: that all being ſubiect to his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he might be glorified in the ſaluation of ſome, for that righteouſnes ſake which is in his ſonne, and that oblation of his offered vp, not for himſelfe but for others: from whoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes ſo much is detracted as we attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues, or ſeeke to attaine vnto, in reſpect of ſatisfying Gods iuſtice: and ſo much impaired of Gods mercy, as we ſhall reſt vpon any vertue or power in our ſelues, whereby to auoid his ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of iuſtice: Our election as it firſt riſeth from God, and is eſtabliſhed in his immutable counſell and decree, and lyeth in no power elſe befide: ſo the hazard thereof is not committed to the aduenture of our frailty, but the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſtablenes in the ſame decree hath the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation. For alas the wofull experience of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams frailty in his beſt eſtate giueth ſufficient teſtimony, and more then ſufficient: what hope there is of continuance of grace, if the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our ſaluation ſhould depend vpon our keepe: who without ſupport of God are like the wynde inconſtant and as fraile as the tender hearbs, and want all habil tie of withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the affaults
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6813:123"/>of our enimie: and conſtant perſeuerance in any religious vertue, and worke of pietie. Then if the foundation of our election lie in the counſell of God, and be founded vpon his decree: who hath reuealed the one but the Spirit of the Lord, and what is able to vndermine the other where the Lord himſelfe hath layed the corner ſtone? This aſſurance in time paſt the Spirite of God hath confirmed vnto you, &amp; you haue felt it with ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heauenly ioy, and comfort: and if in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of temptation you eſteeme the ſtrength ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that remaineth after the battaile, or that which you feele being ſomewhat tyred in the conflict: you may here giue vauntage to the ennemy through diſcouragement, and looſe the field as much as lieth in you, wher there is hope of aſſured victory. For, be it that you feele the hability weake, and the ennemy ſtrong, and your owne corruption vpon the point to preuaile, yet conſider there is a roote of this vertue, whoſe fruite, and braunches although theſe ſtormy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes may nippe and ſhake, yet the ſappe ſhall neuer be dried vp in the roote, neither can anie euill winde of Sathan ſo blaſt, that the immortall ſeed be at any time quit withered, yea though all his fiery dartes be thereto with all might and maine employed, but that the ſtorme being blone ouer by the ſpirite of grace, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſunne of conſolation ſhining vpon our gloumie heartes, it will budde forth againe into bloſſome, fruit, and braunch, as a moſt beautifull tree in the paradice of God. Let the compariſon of bodely ſicknes, and the conſideration of that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6813:123"/>kinde of frailty, giue comforte vnto you in your caſe although in an other kinde, yet in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not vnlike. We haue experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce how diuerſe times the deſeaſe preuaileth ouer the ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that actions faile and faculties ſeeme quite to be ſpent, neither hand nor foote is able to do their duetie, the eye is dimme, the hearing dull, the taſt altered, and the tounge diſtaſteth all things eue of moſt pleaſant reliſh, and the weak and feeble pacient ſeemeth to attend the time of diſſolution: when yet notwithſtanding there remaineth a ſecret power of nature, and a forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpark of life that ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth all theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and conſumeth them like droſſe, &amp; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth to the body a greater purity, &amp; firmenes of health then before the ſicknes it did enioy. Euen ſo eſteeme of the ſpirituall caſe, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that your ſoule is ſicke and not dead, and faith is aſſailed but not ouercome, &amp; only haue patience to attend the finiſhing of this ſecret worke which paſſeth all conceite, and capacity of man, and you ſhall ſee theſe burning feauers, of temptations to be ſlaked and cooled by the mercy and grace of Chriſt, and that ſparke of faith which lieth now hidde, and ouerwhelmed with heapes of temptation, and ſeemeth to be vtterly quenched to breake forth againe, and to conſume theſe ſtraunge cauſes of the deſeaſe of the ſoule, and as nature after a perfect criſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth her ſelf either by ſtoole, vomite, ſweat, or bleeding, or ſuch like euacuations, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of former health, ſo ſhall you feele all theſe doubtes, and feares, and terrors remoued,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:6813:124"/>and ſtrength of faith reſtored with ſuch ſupply, as it ſhall be able to make euident proofe what ſecrete vertue laye hid and yet not idle in all this vncomfortable plight which offereth you temptation of diſpaire. Seing then that you are yet but vnder the conflict: and not ouercome, haue good cheare in the ſucceſſion which as in Chriſt it is victorious, ouer head; ſo are we (his parts &amp; members,) to looke for the ſame crowne of glory, who both ouercome in him, &amp; through him, in our ſelues ſhall in the ende be poſſeſſed of the victory, and receiuethe crowne of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. As for that which your owne conceit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by melancholy perſwadeth you, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sathan is buſie, and omitteth no oportunity: giue no credite thereunto, but as it is, ſo eſteeme it a deluſion which time will diſcouer and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as you your ſelfe ſhall hereafter moſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne. I graunt you, the temptation it ſelfe though your body were free from this infirmity, is of the greateſt kinde, &amp; ſuch as doth not skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh only lightly vpon our ſoules, but ſetteth the maine battaile againſt our moſt happy eſtate, in ſo much as it forced our Sauiour to cry, my God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me. But what then? are we therefore to be diſcouraged? no, no, here appeareth rather the aboundance of Gods grace, and the mightie ſupporte of his power, which euen in the middeſt of hel preſerueth his and ſuffereth not ſo much as their garments to take any ſmell of the flame, but euen from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is able to raiſe them to his celeſtiall kingdome &amp; place, them which his ſonne in the throne of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6813:124"/>glory. And if you dewly conſider the price of our redemption how prerious it was, &amp; how it could not be obtayned, without ſhedding of the moſt pretious heartblood of the ſonne of God, you muſt thinke the quarrell to be no other to the ende, but a matter of blood, of ſtrife, of ſweate, of feare, of ielouſie, and whatſoeuer affection goeth with affecting a glorious triumph in all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, both inwardly and outwardly, in the ſpirite and in the body, as our head himſelfe could finde in diſpenſation though he ſued vnto his father therefrom with aboundance of tears: and thinke that it is Gods buſines we are in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with, and that we are inabled of him, and acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt not theſe ſmal venies of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des which are no thing other but practiſes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the ſpirituall courage, and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and introductions to that vſe of the whole armour of God, where againſt no force of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſhall preuaile, though the attempt ſeeme to be full of perill, &amp; terror. But you ſay you feele ſmall ſtrength of faith, &amp; no ſupport of that hope which maketh not aſhamed. Beware leaſt you iudge vniuſtly of the wayes of God, &amp; eſteeme that for ſmall which is great, and vile which in the ſight of God is moſt pretious. For herein the ennemy may take encouragement to your great diſaduantage. You feele not that taſte thereof you ſometimes felt: and do you iudge therefore you are bereued vtterly thereof? what? conſider the ſoule is now ſick, &amp; diſteſtaeth much whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meate of conſolation, and loatheth many pleaſaunt and fragraunt cuppes of comfort, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6813:125"/>counſell, and yet the indeuours of Gods childre in this behalfe, and the ſweete waters of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort are not therefore of themſelues bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or vnſauory, ſo you are not to meaſure the abſence of this grace by that you preſently, but by that in times paſt (while the ſoule ſtoode free from this diſeaſe of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, &amp; trial) you haue felt of comfort in the ſpirite through an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meaſure of faith according to the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Gods grace, and not according to our fancy, but as he ſhal think meete to be miniſtred vnto vs. Neither is the tryall of faith only to be taken according as the ſoule feeleth it in it ſelfe but alſo and ſometimes (as in ſuch temptations as theſe wherein you now trauaile) onely by the courſe and trade of life which hath paſſed before, and thoſe fruites which are euident to the eye of others who can iudge more ſincerely then the afflicted whoſe vnderſtandinges are ſomewhat altered through Sathans terrors. But againe you ſay the courſe of life paſt, and your eſtate preſent hath nothing aunſwered the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of your vocation, and that ſinceritie the Lord requireth ſo that here alſo the comforte faileth you. What then? are you therefore repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? No, but it argueth want of faith, not ſo, but place for farther increaſe of faith and the fruits thereof. Thoſe whome the Lord hath choſen to be his worſhipers, and hath redeemed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated holy to himſelfe, and prepared good workes for them to walke in: they be his plantes and ingraffed oliue brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches in his ſonne which take not their full perfection at once, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6813:125"/>And if you duly conſider the price of our redemption how pretious it was, &amp; how it could not be obtained, without ſhedding of the moſt pretious hart bloud of the Sonne of God: you muſt thinke the quarrell to be no other to the ende, but a matter of bloud, of ſtrife, of ſweate, of feare, of ielouſie, and whatſoeuer affection goeth with affecting a glorious triumph in all the members of Chriſt: both inwardly, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in the ſpirit and in the bodie: as our head himſelfe could finde no diſpenſation, though he ſued vnto his Father therfore with aboundance of teares: and thinke that it is Gods buſineſſe we are in hand with, &amp; that we are inabled of him, mooued and carried by his ſpirite, increaſe with his increaſes, not to be meaſured with the eye of fleſh, or carnall vnderſtanding, but by the ſame ſpirite which worketh in vs: who as he hath begunne, will alſo make perfect his worke to his owne glory: which lieth in taking pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, more aboundantly then in ſhewing ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. By this which hitherto hath bene ſaid, it appeareth plainly that no ſinne hath yet paſſed you, which can ſeclude you from hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore neceſſarily it followeth that the croſſe you are now vnder is an attempt of Satan againſt you, to caſt you into vtter diſpaire and if it were poſſible to vndoe that knot more ſurely knit then that of Gordius, which coupleth vs vnto our God, and wherewith we are eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto Ieſus Chriſt: euen our moſt glorious faith which ouercommeth the world: &amp; where againſt not Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor all his force, or ſtratageme
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6813:126"/>is able to preuaile. I ſay it is only a temptation of the ennemy purpoſed of him to your confuſion: but from your louing God, and mercifull father, a triall of faith and patience, and the proofe of thoſe vertues which before laye hid in ſecrete: which he will haue now ſhew themſelues in the combat, he himſelfe a beholder, an incourager, a ſuccour at neede, and preſt with the crowne of triumph to giue rewarde, and honour to the victory. Wherefore, only haue patience: be not diſcouraged: ſtand ſure, and the feeblenes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſhall ſoone appeare: and his weapons ſhall be al broaken in peeces, and God (through faith and patience, and comfort of the Scriptures by his ſpirite) ſhall be glorified in the weakenes of his poore afflicted ſeruant: and you ſhall againe (as Dauid was) be reſtored to thoſe wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ioyes which you haue ſometimes felt in the ſweete mercies of the Lord. Now the ground of all te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is our owne weakenes, this is tried and proued by Sathan or the world, or both ioyned together as conſiderations of our deſtruction. Beſides this continual buddes of iniquity which do riſe from our originall corruption, Sathan ſometimes playeth his part vpon our weakenes alone, and ſometimes by outward temptations, and ſometimes layeth ſiege round about vs, and beſetteth all the parts of our complete armour. We are weake in vnderſtanding and in what ſo euer action riſeth therefrom: euen in will &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Our vnderſtanding is turned into blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of error; Our will embraceth not only thoſe thinges which corrupt iudgement directeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:6813:126"/>but euen wher ſometime vnderſtanding ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſound, ther will be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to affection, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth the light of reaſon. Our affections are both rebellious to right iudgement and will: in that they rage where they ſhould not, and wher iuſt cauſe is giuen there they inordinately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Thus iudgement, wil, and affection, hauing degenerated, vſe the bodely members as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and inſtrumentes of all impietye, and in iuſtice: ſo that if the grace of God did not for preſeruation of humaine ſociety, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for his Churches cauſe reſtraine this ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of iniquity, the pillers of the world would ſhatter in ſunder, and the vault of heauen would fall, &amp; all things woulde turne againe to their former Chaos, &amp; be conſumed with the terrible fire of Gods vengeaunce, and periſhe in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy diſpleaſure. Our miſery being ſuch, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though both Sathan and the world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt vs, except the Lord ſtretch foorth his hand, and vphold vs. This our infirmity Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than doth ſometimes aſſaye without meanes: and ſometimes by outward occaſions of euill, &amp; forcible perſwaſion of ſinne, and rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt God. How he doth it without means, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is more lamentable and infallible, then the manner how eaſie to finde out. In corporall poſſeſſion it ſeemeth there needeth no meanes: when Sathan poſſeſſeth all partes of the howſe, and as maiſter commaundeth at his pleaſure. But how without ſuch acceſſe he is able to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, that is a matter of more difficult conſideration: which, becauſe it maketh not a litle to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:6813:127"/>laying open of your eſtate, I will ſomewhat ſtande vpon: referring you for the reſt to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the diuines who haue chiefe part in this buſines. For my owne part I do take it, &amp; am aſſured you find the experience, that Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a perſonall manner vnto the ſoule, though not in bodely ſhape to the eye, without meanes of outward thinges which (might moue our wils or affections) tempteth vs in the very ſecrete thoughts of our heartes. For being a ſpirite, and by creation moſt excellent, it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that he hath a ſpirituall acceſſe vnto our ſpirites, to trouble them, and to diſorder all their actions, as we ſee corporall creatures, with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely and corporall force, to annoy one an other. And as men haue fellowſhip one with other by corporall preſence, and are delighted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the quallities of the minde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they like, or diſlike, vttered by ſpeach &amp; talke: ſo is it moſt like that the ſpirites haue their ſociety maintained by a ſpirituall conference, whereby their wills and purpoſes are entercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated one to an other, without corporall ſound, whereof both the ſpirites want the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the voice nothing affecteth the mind. Dayly experience maketh this manifeſt in ſuch as are poſſeſſed, how Sathan ſo beareth the ſway in them that their ſpeach and phraſe altereth, and their diſcourſe is farre other then before, &amp; their whole nature at Sathans becke, and their vtterance of minde as he only ſuggeſteth. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whome Sathan hath not layed ſuch hold on, the ſame no leſſe is to be ſeene: as when the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:6813:127"/>falſe prophetes did deceiue Ahab: there came forth a ſpirit which was ſent to be a falſe &amp; lying ſpirite in the mouth of all his prophets, which accordingly did make promis vnto him of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding found a contrary euent of ouerthrow, &amp; deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So entred Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iudas the traitor, &amp; moued him to betray our Sauiour, not by a corporall poſſeſſion: but by a ſpirituall impulſion whereby he worketh in the children of diſobedience, and Peter in the fift of the Actes ſayeth to Ananias: why hath Sathan filled thine heart, &amp;c: and againe in the ſecond to the Epheſians the Apoſtle calleth the Deuill the prince that ruleth in the ayre, the ſpirite that nowe worketh in the children of diſobedience: by which it is plaine that the deuill hath power where God permitteth him ouer the minds and iudgements, and wills of the reprobate, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and may alſo in ſuch ſort tempt the faithful ſeruants of God. For the Apoſtle ſaith in the ſame place, that the Epheſians (to whome he wrote) in times paſt walked according to the courſe of this world, &amp; after the conduct of that ſpirite. Neither do we ſtande thus ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sathans annoyance through the ſubtleneſſe of his nature, being a ſpirit; but through that lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g experience and practiſe of our miſerie from age to age, whereby he is able with eaſe to worke our anoyance in all reſpects. This giueth him know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our mindes more perfectly: who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the ſame by the leaſt ſhew, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our affection &amp; wil. Not that he knoweth our harts, entirely and perfectly: which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:6813:128"/>to God only the framer of the hart, but only through that triall and experience which not one onely particular man hath miniſtred vnto him, but euen our whole race from Adam to this preſent: this maketh him not to expect anie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignification of ſpeach, or geſture, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our intents and purpoſes: but out of our vniuerfall corruption whereof he hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proofe, he hath layed vp matter of argument to diſcouer the vanity of our mindes, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughtes of our heart: which after he hath found, he ſuggeſteth (as he ſeeth occaſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we muſt incline) inſtigation of ſinne &amp; diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againſt God, &amp; his holy commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. His temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are properly ſuch, as neither our natures ſeme to incline vnto, but in a generality to all kinde of wickednes; nor the world doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allure vs, or inforce vs: eſpecially the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of god who are partakers of his ſpirit finde them moſt ſtraunge, and ſuch as they abhorre the very leaſt conceite of them, &amp; finde no parte of their nature to incline vnto them, howſoeuer in other reſpectes they complaine of frailty. Of this kinde are certaine blaſphemies ſuggeſted of the Deuill, and laying of violent handes of them ſelues, or vpon others neither moued ther to by hate or malice: or any occaſion of reuenge: of the ſame ſort is the diſpaire and diſtruſt of gods mercy, and grace, beſides many other as taking away the ſeede of the word out of the heart of the negligent hearers: the ſuggeſting of errors &amp; ſuch like without our natures ſpeciall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that way, but rather contrarily affected. And
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:6813:128"/>as he is a ſpirite, &amp; an effectuall worker in other meanes: ſo when he applieth his proper trauaile he attempteth the moſt daungerous aſſaults, to our ſaluation: and entereth ſo deep that (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iudgement is the fountaine of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous action) there he maketh traine, and after a ſpirituall manner ſeeketh poſſeſſion thereof to the vtter deſcouraging of all your actions that depend thereon: knowing that it once being at his deuotion, the corporall groſſe actions &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely vices, neede no great prouocation. Other temptations riſe of our owne rebellious heartes vnto the holy commandementes of God: or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wordely allurements, which as baites entice vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way of obedience: or elſe from terrors of life which ſcar vs with threate of perill, if we embrace the way of piety, and of holines: and ſetteth before vs a greater awe of men, then we haue of feare, &amp; reuerence of God. Now among theſe temptations falleth your preſent eſtate, &amp; eſpecially Sathan employeth his force to your iudgement, and not againſt the ſtrength of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iudgement only, but againſt that which the Spirite of God hath taught and ſealed vnto you in your conſcience: both ſuggeſting vnto you thoſe blaſphemous conceites which your heart vtterly abhorreth the leaſt thought and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of, and raiſeth that doubt of Gods fauour which now diuerſly diſtracteth you. Remember I pray you, how the ſpirite of God calleth him the tempter, the deceiuer of the world: and the accuſer of the faithfull: the Dragon and old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, a lyer, and the father of lies: by which epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6813:129"/>and deſcriptions, you may conſider his power, his malice, and his craft to deceaue, and to abuſe you: neuer before acquainted with his practiſes as at this preſent you haue experience of: and not take all that your minde concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of any manner of impiety whatſoeuer, to be from you, but from Sathan: who as he hath power to tempt and to trie, to caſt before you theſe ſtumbling blockes whereat he would haue you fall: ſo hath he no power to faſten them vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your minde, and to giue them ſetteling: your owne conſcience bearing you witnes how much repugnant they are to your deſires. The rather are you to accompt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, becauſe they be ſuch, as are altogether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to your former conuerſation, &amp; whereto you haue felt your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture incline before, and ſuch as haue no inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor inticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from any creature, but from him. Wherefore though ſuch kinde of thoughts doe aſſaile the hart, that (being guilty of ſo great ſinne) your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce might be ſo much the more defiled, and the diſcouragement the greater; yet aunſwere them againe by the word of God which is the ſworde of the ſpirite: and wayte the happie ende of the conflict with patience: and accompt not theſe ſmall venies of Sathan for deadly wounds, which are nothing elſe but practiſes, &amp; exerciſes of your ſpirituall courage, &amp; circumſpection: &amp; introductions to that vſe of the whole armour of God, where againſt no force of the enemie ſhall preuaile, though the attempt ſeeme to be full of perill, and terrour. But you ſay you feele ſmall ſtrength of faith, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:6813:129"/>no ſupport of that hope which maketh not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Beware leaſt you iudge vniuſtly of the wayes of God, and eſteeme that for ſmall which is great, and vile, which in the ſight of God is moſt pretious. For herein the enemie may take encouragement, to your great diſaduauntage. You feele not that taſte thereof you ſometimes felt: and do you iudge therefore you are bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vtterlie thereof? what? conſider the ſoule is nowe ſicke, and diſtaſteth much wholeſome meate of conſolation, and loatheth many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and fragrant cuppes of comfort, and counſell, and yet the indeuours of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this behalfe, and the ſweete waters of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort are not therefore of themſelues bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or vnſauory, ſo you are not to meaſure the abſence of this grace by that you preſently, but by that in times paſt (while the ſoule ſtoode free from this diſeaſe of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, &amp; trial) you haue felt of comfort in the ſpirite through an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meaſure of faith according to the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Gods grace, and not according to our fancy, but as he ſhal think meete to be miniſtred vnto vs. Neither is the tryall of faith only to be taken according as the ſoule feeleth it in it ſelfe but alſo (and ſometimes as in ſuch temptations as theſe wherein you now trauaile onely) by the courſe and trade of life which hath paſſed before, and thoſe fruites which are euident to the eye of others who can iudge more ſincerely then the afflicted whoſe vnderſtandinges are ſomewhat altered through Sathans terrors. But againe you ſay the courſe of life paſt, and your
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:6813:130"/>eſtate preſent hath nothing aunſwered the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of your vocation, and that ſinceritie the Lord requireth ſo that here alſo the comforte faileth you. What then? are you therfore repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? No, but it argueth wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of faith; Not ſo; but place for farther increaſe of faith, and the fruits thereof. Thoſe whome the Lord hath choſen to be his worſhipers, and hath redeemed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated holy to himſelfe, and prepared good workes for them to walke in: they be his plantes and ingraffed oliue brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches in his ſonne who take not their ful perfection at once (but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of a pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) require dayly wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; dreſſing, wherby by degrees they attaine in the ende a full ſtature in Chriſt. So that you may not accompt your ſelfe voyde of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not perfect (for in this life both faith, and knowledge, and loue are all imperfect, and ſhall partly be furniſhed, and partly receaue perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elſewhere,) but you are godly &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider the ſecret worke of Gods ſpirite, and grace, and take comfort of the ſmalleſt crumme and drop of this heauenly ſuſtentation and attend your time of perfect growth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of God. You can not at all times feele and followe with your conceir, and naturall capacitie the worker of this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: more then you are able to diſcerne where the wind riſeth; and where it lighteth. You know we that are called, are borne againe, and as the growth and increaſe of our bodies is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of vs, though we do increaſe, &amp; the birth is not apprehended of the infant borne &amp; bred,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:6813:130"/>euen ſo is it with vs in the heauenly birth, and ſpirituall regeneration, the ſpirit worketh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our leaue, and acquainteth vs not with his maruelous working more then is expedient at his pleaſure, when, and in what meaſure for our comfort: much leſſe can a body ouercharged with melancholy, &amp; drowned in that darke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ſee the comfortable beames of his dayſtar, &amp; brightneſſe of the cheerfull Sunne of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant mercie, and a mind whoſe actions are hindered by meanes thereof, whereby it neither conceiueth nor iudgeth ſincerely and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the caſe requireth: and neither ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, but blinde folded by the humour, and brought into this darkneſſe of feare, is buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited alſo and beaten with Sathan on all ſides, whereby being diſtracted, it obtayneth no reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and releaſe, of due and iuſt conſideration, howe can it diſcerne rightly of theſe thinges? Wherefore your caſe being ſuch, yeelde not ſo much to the enemy, as to iudge of your ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſentence, who is a lyer from the beginning, and the father of lyes; but according to thoſe olde teſtimonies which you haue felt in your owne conſcience, and haue giuen comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſhewe of to others in the courſe of your life heretofore. Oh, but you feele not the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Gods ſpirit, which might aſſure you. Neither do any of Gods children at all times feele it. Dauid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of the want hereof; Iob complained likewiſe, &amp; ſo haue diuerſe of Gods children in all times made mone hereof. Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient it is if at any time that aſſurance be giuen,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:6813:131"/>and if it be the will of God for a time to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it, that you may feeling your owne frailty, with more earneſt deſire call to him for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grace: Who are you to interrupt the wayes of God, and to preuent his counſelles? and for your comfort be aſſured that the former grace, you haue receaued is of that nature, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer decayeth, but remaineth an euerlaſting ſeed of immortalitie, proceeding from the Father of eternitie, and with whom there is no chaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, nor ſhadowe of turning: who doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to repent him of, but is only wiſe, ſtable, &amp; ſure, and hath no neede to correct anie thing of his owne workmanſhip. And if he with hold the comfort of his ſpirite from you for a ſeaſon, it is that you may with greater appetite ſeeke after it, and hauing found it, more ioy therein, and praiſe his mercie with thankfulneſſe of hart, and readineſſe of vtterance to found out the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his mercie. If the Lord withhold it not, but the frailtie wherein you ſtand, diminiſh the ſenſe thereof, or the temptation preſſe ſo farre vpon you that you are not free to iudge aright, or the perill which the temptation carieth with it moue you to diſtruſt, knowe that nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth you ſtraunge herein more then to other of Gods children before you, and that to wade through theſe violent ſtreames, patience and conſtancie is moſt needfull, with a reſolute mind to abide the Lords wil, who in the end wil come, and will not tarie. This is the broken &amp; contrite heart which the Lord will not deſpiſe, this is the poore ſpirit, on whome the Lord pronounceth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:6813:131"/>bleſſedneſſe, and this is the affliction whereof the Spirit of God is called the comforter? ſo that (although before the Lord hath vouchſafed you many graces,) yet were you neuer meete to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue diuerſe other which he will nowe beſtowe vpon you, before this preſent: and ſo ſhall you in the end receaue the cup of ſaluation in ſteed of the bottell of vineger and teares, and in ſteed of the bread of affliction the heauenly Manna, and the bread of life from the table of God &amp; Chriſt. Wherefore ſuſpect theſe thoughtes to be of the enemie and not of your ſelfe, caſt into your mind of him, and not ſpringing of incredulitie: I am out of Gods fauour: I am reprobate from his kingdome, there remaineth no hope for me: I haue no faith. For ſuch are his temptations of old, &amp; daily they be the points he laboureth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if not to wring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hope, at the leaſt to weary their dayes with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe, and diſcomfort. Neither eſteeme your ſelfe, preſently by that you feele; but by that you haue felt, when nothing hath ouerſhadowed that light of knowledge, faith, and zeale, but the full brightneſſe of theſe graces hath broken forth. For why haue not theſe doubts riſen vnto you before time? and where is nowe the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aſſurance? They before time roſe not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the temptation was far of, and that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance although by tempeſt of temptation, and by this ſpirituall ſtorme it ſeeme to bend, and to giue backe, yet is it inuincible, and recouereth thereby more ſtrength then euer it had before. Is the ſouldier worſe appayed that ſuſtaineth
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:6813:132"/>the combat, and ſtandeth in the face of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, though the terrible thunder of ſhot beat his eares, and he in perill of hitting; though he maintaine the heate of the battell againſt the force of his enemie with perill? not a whit: he becommeth hereby more valiant: he learneth experience, his skill increaſeth, and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage doubleth vppon him. So in this ſpirituall battaile you muſt not be diſcouraged like a milk ſoppe, or a freſh ſouldier vntrained or vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with warfare: but ſet the victorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, which is alreadie attained and purchaſed for you: and ſo much the more are you to endure with Chriſtian valiance, in that here is no feare of ouerthrowe: the battaile is broken, and the enemies ſcattered, and onely the captaine requireth to be followed of you for whome he hath obtained the crowne of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if the ſtragling tayle of the enemie annoye they may ſhewe their malice and hoſtilitie but their force is foyled; and take heart onely, and endure, and you ſhall ſee them vanquiſhed, and ſubmit vnto that power of Chriſt which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth you. You muſt conſider that as in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare the ſeruice is not alwayes alike, neither keepeth the ſouldier the ſame degree, but is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced of the generall as he ſeeth cauſe: euen ſo if the Lorde nowe beſtowe you in a ſtraunge peece of ſeruice in his ſpirituall warre, and place you in the forefront, whome he hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto tendered as your condition required, you muſt be contented, and quite your ſelfe like a man, and knowe that the wiſedome of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:6813:132"/>the heauenly captaine is ſuch, and his tender affection ſo great towarde his followers, that in the middeſt of perill, not one haire of them ſhall miſcarrie whom he leadeth. Then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, ſeing your caſe is onely a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and no temptation is of it ſelfe (except that one) a ſigne of reprobation: caſt of theſe diſcouragementes: and learne howe to behaue your ſelfe herein, that you may paſſe through with credit of your vocation, and honour vnto God, &amp; ioy &amp; comfort to your faithful friends in the Lord Ieſus. You haue read your ſelfe &amp; may partly perceaue by my former diſcourſe howe melancholie perſwadeth of miſerie where there is no cauſe, &amp; ſome haue imagined them ſelues to haue wanted their heads, ſome their armes, other ſome haue thought themſelues dead men, and other ſome one member of their bodies as bigge as three: which as it perſwadeth in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things that which is not, ſo no leſſe doth it in ſpirituall things eſpecially, being like a weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taken into Sathans hand, and vſed to all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of our hurt and deſtruction. This maketh all more grieuous, &amp; is called of Serapio, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeate of the deuill being an apt inſtrument for him, both to weaken our bodies with, and to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our minds with vaine, &amp; fantaſticall feares, and to diſturbe the whole tranquillity of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore aſcribe I pray you theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of your mind to no other, but to the frailty of your bodie: I meane this exceſſe of diſtruſt, &amp; feare, otherwiſe the temptation may be without it: and giue no way to Sathans practiſe, in yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:6813:133"/>your iudgement and affection to his ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but reſiſt as againſt a ſickneſſe, and as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth with her ſpirit againſt bodily diſeaſe, ſo take courage, and call together the wiſdome, and knowledge God hath giuen you, and nowe put it in vſe againſt this ſubtle, and forcible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. And through Gods bleſſing by due vſe of ſuch naturall means as I ſhall hereafter declare vnto you, both mind and bodie ſhall againe be reſtored to the former integritie, and you haue greater cauſe then euer to prayſe God for his mercie, and goodneſſe towardes you. Hitherto nothing hath befallen you, that diuerſe of Gods children haue not paſſed through before you, &amp; although the battaile hath bene ſharp &amp; bloudy euen as our Maiſter hath ſweat dropps of bloud in the like combat, remember the victorie is the more glorious, and the conqueſt ſo much the more honorable &amp; ſure: as we haue experience in the perſon of Ieſus our Sauiour which found no other way to his kingdome, and hath left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs an example of like patience, conſtancie, &amp; hope, and whatſoeuer vertue elſe is requiſite to this battaile of the ſpirit, and doth furniſh vs in all partes with ſpirituall armour. He girdeth vs with truth, and buckleth on vs the breſtplate of righteouſneſſe: he ſhoeth our feet with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Goſpell of peace: he deliuereth into the left hand the ſhield of faith, wherby we may quench the firie dartes of the deuill, &amp; into the right, the ſword of the ſpirite, the word of God, and couereth our heads with the helmet of ſaluation. If we ſhall cowardly caſt our armor
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6813:133"/>and weapon from vs, and betake vs to flight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there is no place of ſafetie, we ſhall diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our captaine, giue ouer our ſelues to the pleaſure and crueltie of our enemie, and finally periſh for euer. Wherefore trie the ſtrength of this armour, and the ſharpneſſe of this ſword, &amp; nowe occaſion is offered, march on with thoſe ſhoes of peace, which is the ende of warre, and wherof they are the pledge and aſſurance, hold out that ſhield of faith, and although it be bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on all ſides, yet forſake it not, for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſuch as no fierie darte of the wicked can pierce it: and beſtowe that ſword of Gods word, the word of conſolation, of ioy, of aſſurance, of ſpirituall and heauenly wiſedome, whereby the iudgement is perfected, &amp; the hart eſtabliſhed, and the whole man of God made abſolute. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not that breaſtplate of the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, and that frute of our ſanctification whereby we are in his Sonne acceptable vnto God: &amp; with the helmet of ſaluation couer your head, that all the good meanes of God being to the full employed, you may fecle the power of this heauenly furniture to your preſent encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, &amp; herafter to your euerlaſting ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let not your ſinnes diſmay you, for Chriſt came not to ſaue the righteous, he ſupplieth all our wantes, and hath aboundance to diſcharge our debtes. In him is God well pleaſed with vs, as him ſelfe hath pronounced, ſo that being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in him, let vs giue ouer all feare, &amp; with boldnes approch vnto the throne of grace that we may receaue the mercie promiſed vnto vs,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6813:134"/>for if we be righteouſe, then is Chriſt vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuffered for him ſelfe, and not for vs: but he was iuſt &amp; pure, a lambe without ſpot or blemiſh ſlaine for the attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we might thereby liue, broaken that we might be healed, and humbled for our aduancement. Wherefore lay the burthen vpon him, who hath ſayd, come vnto me all ye that are heauy loden, and he ſhall eaſe your wearied ſhoulders thereof, and geue you refreſhing. If ther were no ſinne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould Gods mercie be ſhewen? and whereto tendeth the promiſe of the Goſpell? But you ſay you are a great ſinner: what then? is not the mercie of God greater? is there anie ende of his compaſſion? If ſinne do abound, who ſhall ſtint the grace of God, that it ſhould not alſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow? Dauid was a great ſinner, ſo was both Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Paule: yet were they not refuſed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued mercie. And if the grace of God were ſo great, that our ſinnes could not withholde his mercie when we were ſtraungers from his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, aliens from the common wealth of Iſraell, and led with that ſpirit of errour, and darkneſſe, like the nations that knowe not God; much more being reconciled, ſtand we ſure, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoueable in his fauour, though the cloudes do ſomtimes ouercaſt the bright beames therof, &amp; our owne imbecillitie comprehendeth it not. Remember the tryall of Iob: who would haue taken him for other, then one forſaken of the Lord? what were his thoughts? let the day periſh wherin I was borne. Why died I not in the birth? wherefore is light giuen vnto him that is in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6813:134"/>and life vnto them that haue heauy harts? And in an other place: oh that I were as in times paſt! when God preſerued me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon my head, &amp;c. But what was the tryall? God bleſſed the laſt dayes of Iob more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt: euen ſo, though the preſent afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto you, and all hope faile in reſpect of your feeling, yet the Lord when he hath proued you and found you his pure and ſincere beloued ſonne, the like iſſue are you aſſured of with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte in this life, and eternall ſaluation in the life to come. Thus leauing a more plentifull conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation vnto your godly friendes who dayly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent you, eſpecially ſuch as are preachers of the word and miniſters of Gods grace, I proceed to inſtruct you in that I iudge your body ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in neede of, that howſoeuer hability faile in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the offices of friendſhips on my part, towards you, my ſincere affection and vnfayned loue vnto you may be at the leaſt teſtified by my endeuour: wherein if I be tedious partly it is of forgetfulnes of that conſideration, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried with deſire to benefite you, and partly bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in your caſe I alſo comprehend the eſtate of many one at this day in like ſort affected and afflicted, who if they receiue any meanes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </head>
               <p>AS the ordinarie cure of all diſeaſes, &amp; helps of infirmities are to be begun with remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſuch cauſes as firſt procured the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie (except they be remoued of them ſelues, through their nature, neither ſtable nor perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) by ſucceſſion of a contrarie cauſe of the ſame kinde: euen ſo the firſt entry of reſtoring the melancholicke braine and heart, to a better ſtate of conceit, and cheere, is the remouing of ſuch cauſes as firſt diſturbed iudgement, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or are therto apt, with inducing of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of contrarie operation. The cauſes of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are either breach of dutie, and ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the gouernment of our health; or ſuch accidentes as befall vs in this life againſt our wills, and vnlooked for. From the ſame alſo do ariſe the workes of melancholie, whereof I intreate, and you deſire to be releaſed. Our diet conſiſteth not onely (as it is commonly taken) in meate, and drinke: but in whatſoeuer exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of mind or bodie: whether they be ſtudies of the braine, or affections of the hart, or whether
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6813:135"/>they be labours of the bodies, or exerciſes only. Beſides vnto diet, houſe, habitation, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel do belong, which are cauſes of maintenance, or ouerthrowe of health, as they be affected. To theſe alſo the order of reſt, and ſleepe is to be added as a great meanes, taken in due time, and in conuenient moderation, to preſerue health, or to cauſe ſickneſſe, if otherwiſe it be taken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, too ſcant, or diſorderly. Of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the mind, ſtudies haue great force to procure melancholie: if they be vehement, and of difficult matters, and high miſteries: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chiefly they are to be auoyded, &amp; the mind to be ſet free from all ſuch trauel, that the ſpirits which before were partly waſted, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: and partly employed vpon hard diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may be releaſed, to the comfort of the hart, and thinning of the bloud. Beſides, ſuch actions approching nigh vnto, or being the verie inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall of the ſoule, cauſe the mind to neglect the bodie: whereby eaſily it becmometh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward vnapt for the action, and the humours skanted of the ſweet influence thereof, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſetle into a melancholie thickneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gele into that cold and drie humour, which ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth theſe terrours and diſcouragements. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aboue all, abandon working of your braine by any ſtudie, or conceit: and giue your mind to libertie of recreation, from ſuch actions, that drawe too much of the ſpirit, and therby wrong the corporall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the bodie. For in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of health it is ſpecially to be obſerued, that the employing of the parts either of mind
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6813:136"/>or bodie with their ſpirite, is to be carried with ſuch indifferencie, and diſcretion; that the force which ſhould be common to manie, be not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhly ſpent vpon any one. Nowe, ſtudie, of all actions, both becauſe it vſeth litle help of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in compariſon of other: and becauſe the minde chieflie laboureth, which draweth the whole bodie into ſympathie, wherby it is negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as it were for a time, and the moſt ſubtile &amp; pureſt ſpirits thereby are conſumed, is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer in the cure of this paſſion: or if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can not be tempered wholly therefrom, then ſuch matter of ſtudie is to be made choyſe of, as requireth no great contention, but with a certaine mediocritie, may vnbend that ſtreſſe of the minde, through that ouer vehement action, and withall carie a contentedneſſe thereto, and ioy to the affection. Nowe as all contention of the mind is to be intermitted, ſo eſpecially that, whereto the melancholicke perſon moſt hath giuen him ſelfe before the paſſion is chieflie to be eſchued, for the recouerie of former eſtate, and reſtoring the depraued conceit, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affection. For there, if the affection of liking go withall, both hart, and braine do ouer prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſpend their ſpirits, and with them the ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt partes of the naturall iuyce, and humours of the bodie. If of miſlike, and the thing be by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible conſtraint layd on, the diſtracting of the mind, from the promptnes of the affection bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſuch an agonie in our nature, that thereon riſeth alſo great expeence of ſpirit, and of the moſt rare and ſubtile humours of our bodies,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6813:136"/>which are as it were the ſeate of our naturall heate, the refiner of all our humours, and the purifier of our ſpirites. As that kind of ſtudie, wherein the melancholicke hath ſpent him ſelfe is to be auoyded, or intermitted, and one of a milder and ſofter kinde to be inferred in place thereof, ſo much leſſe anie ſtraunge ſtudie of difficultie, and much trauell of the braine is to be taken in hand, as it were to turne the minde into a contrarie bent. For herein the ſtraunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beſides difficultie giueth cauſe of trauaile and toile vnto our nature: ſo that both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities are to be eſchued of you as moſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and hurtfull, and the mind to be retired to ſuch a tranquillitie, as the naturall heate and ſpirits may haue free ſcope to attend vppon the corporall actions of preparing the bloud, and thinning of the groſſe iuice into a moderate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as is according to good diſpoſition of the bodie. In ſtudie I comprehend (although they be diuerſe) all action of internall ſenſes, which are miniſters and ſeruants of ſtudie, whether it be of learning, or of meditation, and inuention: which later kind, farre more toyleth the bodie, then the former, and therefore farther of is it to be remoued. Of internall ſenſes, I take phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be the greateſt waſt of theſe ſpirits, &amp; moſt apt to thicken the bloud, if it be exceſſiue. For that imitateth the inuentiue action of the mind, and in a lower degree (if it be vehement &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall) maketh great waſt of thoſe two inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſpirit, and heate, in the me lancholicke bodie. For as the action is, ſuch is the ſpirit, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6813:137"/>part thereof purer, ſubtiler, thinner, as the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of more excellency, &amp; farther remoued from corporall practiſe, and draweth nigher to the cleere, and pure actions of the minde. If the melancholicke be ouer much contemplatiue, it ſhall then be meete for him to withdrawe his mind to corporall actions of groſſer ſort: that as the mind by ſpeculation, after a ſort diſioyneth it ſelfe from the bodie: ſo the bodily exerciſe may reuoke it againe into the former fellowſhip, and exerciſe of bodily action. The outwarde ſenſes becauſe they conſiſt rather in a kinde of paſſion, their vſe doth not greatly hinder the thinneſſe, which we require againſt melancholie, except they be ouer trauelled with watching, which hath great force to drinke vp the ſpirites &amp; moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and ſo to alter the bodily ſtate into a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie diſpoſition, tedious to mind and body. In their actes it is to be obſerued, that they be not in anie reſpect irkeſome, or odious. For if they be ſuch, the heart continually where the obiect is preſented, nowe growne tender tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the internall paſſion, flieth at the ſhadow of euerie thing that carrieth the ſmalleſt ſhewe of diſcontentment: and reclaiming his ſpirites about him ſelfe, leaueth the outwarde partes deſtitute of conuenient meaſure, and by aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance about it ſelfe, corrupteth them in time, for want of ſufficient reſpiration and breathing; which no leſſe ingendreth melancholie, then the former diſorders afore mentioned; and as for the fearefull paſſion, it increaſeth it direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and keepeth that immoderate feare in vre. Of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6813:137"/>all ſenſible obiectes, the viſible, except they be pleaſaunt, and proportionall, giue greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment to the melancholike. If beſides their horribleneſſe of ſhape, (or without it) they repreſent anie ſignificant type of tragicall calamitie, or mention that, wherewith the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke apprehenſion faigne anie fearefull obiect: much more ſuch ſpectacles are to be ſhunned of the melancholickes. And becauſe darkeneſſe is as it were a patterne of death, it alſo is as much as may be to be auoyded, and all cheerefull ſights, agreeable to vertue and pietie, and to be embraced, and ſought after; which as the other ſorte, cloſe vp the ſpirites, and geueth the heart aſſaults of hoſtilitie, may allure them out againe, and ſet free the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed affection, and yeelde comfort to the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed heart. Next to viſible thinges, the audible obiect moſt frighteth the melancholicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eſpecialy beſids the vnpleaſantneſſe, if it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth alſo ſignification of terror: &amp; here as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant pictures, and liuely colours delight the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke eye, and in their meaſure ſatisfie the heart, ſo not onely cheerefull muſicke in a generalitie, but ſuch of that kinde as moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth is to be ſounded in the melancholicke eare: of which kinde for the moſt part is ſuch as carieth an odde meaſure, and eaſie to be diſcerned, except the melancholicke haue skill in muſicke, and require a deeper harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. That contrarilie, which is ſolemne, and ſtill: as dumpes, and fancies, and ſette mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, are hurtfull in this caſe, and ſerue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6813:138"/>for a diſordered rage, and intemperate mirth, to reclaime within mediocritie, then to allowe the ſpirites, to ſtirre the bloud, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the humours, which is (if the harmony be wiſely applyed) effectuallie wrought by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke. For that which reaſon worketh by a more euident way, that muſicke as it were a magicall charme bringeth to paſſe in the mindes of men, which being forſeene of wiſe law giuers in times paſt, they haue made choice of certaine kindes thereof, and haue reiected the other, as hurtfull to their common wealthes; which agreement betwixt concent of muſicke, and affection of the minde, when Ariſtophenes perceaued, he therby was moued to thinke, that the mind was nothing elſe but a kind of harmonie. In the other ſenſes the obiectes onely are to be choyſed, ſweete in taſt, pleaſant in ſmell, and ſoft to be felt, that all outward things may allure, and giue courage in ſteed of that cowardly timiditie wrought by the humour. Motion doth much more, if it be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and drawe to the nature of labour, and withall continuall. For that drieth the bodie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely. And although for the preſent it be hotter through ſuch trauell: yet conſuming the ſpirite and moyſture, which are matter of this heate: in the ende it decayeth alſo, as fire without fuell, and the lampe without oyle. As theſe actions of bodie and minde being ouer vehement, and exceſſiue bereaue the humour of ſpirite, and waſte the naturall heat, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent, whatſoeuer elſe is of the body is more groſſe and earthie, &amp; becommeth a lake of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6813:138"/>euen ſo if altogether theſe actions ceaſe, that neither the minde nor bodie beſtow themſelues in good ſtudies and exerciſes, then on the contrary part this worketh the ſame that the other exceſſe doth: and euen as water that ſtandeth, and is not ſtirred, corrupteth, &amp; wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth groſſe and thicke; and like as the lampe that wanteth aire goeth out, though plenty of oyle be miniſtred; euen ſo without this ſtirring of ſpirites, humours, &amp; blood, all ſettle into a groſſe reſidence of melancholie, and the whole maſſe of bloud eaſily degenerateth vnto that humour and for want of exerciſe the naturall fire being ſlakened, and the ſpirite thereby ingroſſed, that which indued with both with iuſt meaſure, and equalitie conuenient, was before a cheerefull iuyce comfortable to all the parts, and a ſweete deawe to the earthy ſubſtance, congealeth into a groſſeneſſe farre vnmeet for that vſe, and of a quite contrarie diſpoſition.</p>

               <p>AS in ſtudies, exerciſes of the braine, ſenſe, &amp; voluntary motion, great moderation is to be kept of melancholy perſons: euen ſo no leſſe regarde (if not more) is to be had of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and guiding them with ſuch wiſe conduct, as at no time they breake forth into outrage, and ſhake of the gentle and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6813:139"/>light yoake which reaſon impoſeth. I will not now diſpute whether vehement ſtudy, or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perturbations is more to be taken heed of onely take you no leſſe care in the one then in the other, except you finde your ſelfe to haue fallen into exceſſe, and to haue ſurfeted more of this, then of that exceſſe: If you haue ſo vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually exceeded, and the effect hath preuayled with you: that kind, wherof you haue moſt cauſe to complaine, there refraine, and employ thoſe giftes of wiſedome, and vertue wherein in times paſt you haue bene a patterne to others: and there keepe the ſtraighteſt hand, where the liſts of reaſon are moſt like to be broke through. You haue had declared how the exceſſiue trauaile of animall actions, or ſuch as ſpringe from the braine, waiſt and ſpende that ſpirite which as it is in the world the only cheerer of all thinges, &amp; diſpenſeth that life imparted of God to al other creatures, ſo in mans nature, is the only comfort of the terreſtriall members: which ſpirite being conſumed, or empaired, leaueth the Maſſy patrs more heauie, groſſe, and dull, and farther of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from all prompt, and laudable action of life: this effect as it is wrought by that kinde of diſorder, in like manner, a perturbation wheron reaſon ſitteth not, and holdeth not the raine, is of the ſame aptnes to diſturbe the goodly order, diſpoſed by iuſt proportion in our bodies: &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the parts of that moſt conſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; pleaſant harmony out of tune deliuer a note, to the great diſcontentment of reaſon, and much againſt the mindes will, which intendeth far other, then the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6813:139"/>corporall inſtrument effecteth. If you will call to minde hiſtories, you may remember how ſome haue died of ſorrow, and otherſome of ioy, and ſome with feare, ſome with ielouſie, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome with loue: haue bin bereaued of their witts euen thoſe moſt excellent in al the parts of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſound vnderſtanding, and therby haue made ſuch perturbance of ſpirit in their braines that for credite of wiſedome, and in ſteade of reputation: of diſcreite men they haue through theſe latter kindes of vnbridled affections, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely caried the name of fooles, and men voide of all diſcreete conſideration, in the whole race of their life following. This commeth to paſſe in ſome by troubling of ſpirite only which require not alone due quantity, and temper, but a calme ſetling, and tranquillity, moued indifferently, as iuſt matter of perturbation ſhall giue occaſion. In otherſome by lauiſh waſte, and predigall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the ſpirite in one paſſion, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with iudgement, would ſuffice the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of many worthy actions beſides. Hereto may furthermore adde, that as a member of the corporall body ouer veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly forced by ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is in perill of luxation, &amp; ſometimes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by becommeth altogether diſioynted, and the parte looſeth the freedome of flexible motion, euen ſo the ſpirite, ouerforcible ſtrained to one vehement paſſion: carieth the diſpoſition of the parte therewith, and in giuing ouer by too much yeelding to the violence of our paſſion, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth as it were crooked that way, and with an ouer reach of the raigning perturbation, being paſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6813:140"/>recouery, inclineth wholly whereto it was forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly driuen. Wherefore the perturbations are diſcreetely ſo to be ruled as alwayes there do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſufficient power in reaſons hande to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine. Of theſe ſome perturbations directly &amp; immediatly increaſe both paſſion and humour, of which ſorte are ſaddenes, and feare. Other ſome paſſing meaſure, not ſo much of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues procure either, as they doe feeble the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke bodies, as anger, and ioy, both by exceſſiue effuſion of ſpirites, and ſuddaine alteration from the heartes contraction to ſuch dilatation as thoſe affections procure. In ioy if it breake forth into immoderat laughter: then doth it more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the melancholickes, and breath out there ſpirites and leaue a paine in their ſides and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which partes are greatly trauailed in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For although it ſhould ſeeme meete in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the thinning of the humor by flowing of ſpirite, and blood into the outward partes from the inward center, and alteration of the paſſion by the contrary affection, yet the feeblenes of their bodies, and skant of ſpirites their humors being vnapt for plentiful ſupplie, reſpect not that conſideration, but require ſuch an expulſion of one affection by the other, that the bodie it ſelfe notwithſtanding ſuſtaine no detrement: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the combate would be ſo ſore, that nature not being able to beare the force of ech paſſion, would be diſſolued by violence of that contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that as all matter of feare is to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donned, exceſſiue ioy is alſo to be eſchewed as a great feebler of melancholick perſons, chiefly
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6813:140"/>if they be women, or of tender and rare habite. If the melancholie riſe of any perturbation, that eſpecially is to be altered, &amp; brought into a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity wherof the paſſion take firſt beginning. Among them feare, and heauines are of moſt force, and as they are procured according to the vehemency of the cauſe, ſo the kinde of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and feare more or leſſe encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tereth reaſon, and frighteth the melancholicke heart. We both feare, and are ſadde for the loſſe of thoſe things which with delight and pleaſure in time paſt we enioyed, and are tormented with deſpaire, and griefe when (in thoſe thinges which we deſire,) there is no hope to lay hold on. Among the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie ſortes of ſubiectes to theſe paſſions, ſome are of neceſſity, and ſome of pleaſure. Such as are of neceſſity either reſpect the natural main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our bodies and liues, or honeſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongeſt men. The naturall maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life is of ſuch force in this caſe that it moueth beyonde meaſure euen the wiſeſt and moſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and admitteth no moderation. If it be imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie of body &amp; voide of paine it is borne more tolerable. Reputation, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertuous, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious diſpoſition tender as their liues: wherby they are in a manner in like caſe and ſometimes more affected with hazard thereof, then if life were in daunger. The reaſon is becauſe credite and eſtimation toucheth the whole perſon of the man, and not either minde or body onely, &amp; hath the leaſt meanes (being onceloſt) to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered againe, and beſides the diſgrace in this life, man (being immortall in ſoule) ſtandeth in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:6813:141"/>awe of the perpetual note of infamy which may remaine after his death. This paſſion is moſt hardlie borne of the ambitious and proude man in reſpect of that opinion he entertaineth of his owne worthines: &amp; next vnto him it ſetleth deep in the minde enlarged with the vertue called magnanimitie, in reſpect his honor aunſwereth not his merites. The obiectes which are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, if they be naturall, and not helonging to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one part, but vnto the whole nature, of which ſorte is that loue which vpholdeth the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of kinde, and is the onely glue to couple the ioynts of this great frame of the world together: Here reaſon is often times failed of the paſſion, and (carried captiue) ſubmitteth where it ſhould haue preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; rule. If it be of other things which nature hath not ſo wedded together, the loſſe is borne with more tolleration, and where there is peril of want in them, deſpaire toucheth more lightly. In reſpect of their owne nature ſuch is the condition of the thinges we deſire in this world. But becauſe the diuerſe qualities of men taketh them ſometimes otherwiſe: therfore that paſſion and thoſe occaſions moſt vrge as the partie is therwith moſt paſſionate: ſome one way, ſome an other, as nature bendeth, or edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath framed. In theſe caſes of griefe and heauines firſt of all inſtruction out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God is to be miniſtred, and embraced, which offering the aſſuraunce of farre better thinges, then the price of all wordly treaſures, may ſwallow vp whatſoeuer calamitie this vale of miſerie preſſeth vpon vs: next, preceptes of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6813:141"/>morall vertue and patience, with examples of conſtancie, and moderaton in like caſes ought to moue, and conſideration of that vncertaintie of pleaſure in this world, which is only conſtant in inconſtancie, and as the heauens them ſelues ſtand not ſtill, and the nature of things receaue continual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming like a ſtreame that paſſeth: euen ſo our ſtate is ſubiect vnto like mutabilitie, and with no other condition is our life deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs of nature, through that original diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, nor is to be otherwiſe accepted of wiſe men. In this caſe I referre the melancholick to the bookes of the Scriptures, and morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Philoſophers, to the godly inſtructions of the diuines, and comfort of their friends. If loue not aunſwered againe with like kindneſſe, procure this paſſion, either amendes is that way to be made, or the melancholick is to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſubiect of that he liketh is not ſo louely, and all mention, and ſignification of that kind is not once to be called into minde, but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer iuſtly may be alleadged to the parties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace is to be obiected vnto the amorous melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke, and other delights brought in in ſteed, and more highly commended, which all I leaue to the prudencie of thoſe that attend vpon this kind of cure. And if no other perſwaſion will ſerue a vehement paſſion, of another ſort is to be kindeled, that may withdrawe that vaine and fooliſh ſorowe into ſome other extremity, as of anger, of ſome feare miniſtred by another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then that which firſt was authour of this ſadneſſe. For although they both breed a diſlike,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:6813:142"/>yet that proceedeth of other cauſe, rebateth the force of it which gaue firſt occaſion, and as one pinne is driuen out with another, ſo the later may expell the former: but this is to be vſed in regard of the conceit, and affection. If the body therby be altered, and the bloud thickened into melancholie, then all kind of greeuance, is to be ſhunned, and onely pleaſaunt, and delectable things to be admitted. Thus much for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke affection, how it is to be moderated and guided: other kinds of actions, of body, are not any cauſes of this paſſion, except in ſuch as were wont by periods to be purged of certayne melancholick bloud: which (if it faile and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cauſe, or increaſe of this humour,) is to be diminiſhed by opening a vaine, that may moſt conueniently ſupply that want of nature, and disburthen it of the ſuperfluitie, as cauſe ſhall require, and force, &amp; ſtrength will permit. Eaſe and reſt although it be alone of ſmall power to ingender, yet may it be an helping cauſe to the paſſion, &amp; increaſe of this humour, ſo that here in mediocritie is to be kept, and exerciſe of one ſort or other neuer to be omitted, as the chiefe temper of the ſpirits with the humours, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of corporall actions. Fot as ſleepe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth death, and reſt of the members is their kind of ſleepe, &amp; doth that in particulars which ſleepe doth in the whole, ſo (if it exceede) as ech reſemble other in nature, in effect they will not be much vnlike: but as the one cooleth the bodie, and corrupteth the bloud, and extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth naturall heate, whoſe extinction is death
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6813:142"/>it ſelfe, euen ſo the other in a degree hinder the preſent expreſſing of that liuely vigour, which they poſſeſſe, and diſableth them afterwarde to make proofe of the facultie, wherewith they are indued. And thus haue you in theſe two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters what gouernment melancholicke perſons are to obſerue in their actions, and deedes that concerne maintenance of health: in the next, I will lay open vnto you of the outwarde meanes of ſuſtentation of life what choiſe is to be made, and with what diſcretion ſuch reliefe is to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe reſt of diet, conſiſteth in the right vſe of outward ſuſtentation of life, which is either taken inward, or is outwardly vſed only. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſuch as is to be receaued into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: is either aire, or ſuſtenance. The ayre meet for melancholicke folke, ought to be thinne, pure and ſubtile, open, and patent to all winds: in reſpect of their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per, eſpecially to the South, and Southeaſt, except ſome other imbecillity of their bodies diſſuade therefrom, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie part, marriſh, miſtie, and foggie ayre is to be eſchued as an increaſe of both humour, and paſſion. Suſtenaunce is either meate or drinke. Their meates ought not onely to be choſen ſuch
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:6813:143"/>as of their owne nature do ingender to pure and thinne iuyce, but if the nature of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be otherwiſe, the preparation ought to giue it a correction of that fault, and generallie they ſhould be liquide, and in forme of brothes, that both by the moyſt qualitie thereof, the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the humour, and their bodies might be refourmed, and that the paſſage &amp; concoction might alſo be more eaſie, and ſpeedy in all their partes. Nouriſhmentes of their owne nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong meats, wholſome and meet for melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke folke, and of vegetable things, are parſnep, carret, and skerret roots. And ſallet herbs, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, mallowes, and endiue mixed with a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of rocket, and taragon, are not to be refuſed, no more is aretch, ſorell and purſlane with the late twaine aboue mentioned, or with perſley, charuell and fenell, with litle vineger, plenty of oyle and ſuger. Of ſorts of bread, cheat bread, is meeteſt for them, and if they be charged with ſtore of bloud, and the vaines full, ſome oates, barley, or millet flower mingled with the wheat meele, ſhall abate the aboundant nouriſhment of the wheat. Of frutes, ſuch as are moyſt, ſoft, and ſweet are meeteſt for them, as the iuyce, damſing, cherrie, figges, grapes, and abricots: neither are newe walnuts, and greene almonds hurtfull in this caſe. Capers waſhed from the ſalt and vineger, and eaten with ſuger and oyle are meeter for them then oliues. Of fleſh, the young is fitteſt for their diet, and the younger the better, in reſpect of their colde and drie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and groſſe humours, which require plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:6813:143"/>moyſtening and warming, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the tender age of thoſe things whereof we feede: being fuller of vitall heate, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall moyſture, then the older of the ſame kind. Neither is it requiſite that they be young onely, but alſo well liking, and of the ſame kinde the tame, and domeſticall is meete for correction of their melancholicke ſtate, then the wilde. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of fleſh, the foule is to be preferred for their vſe before the beaſt, and that foule rather which vſeth much the feete, and leſſe the wing. Of foule theſe are of eſpecciall choyce for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke perſons, the partridge, the godwit, the yong pigeon, the pullet, the feaſant, &amp; the yong turky, among theſe the gooſe wing hath his place, not to be refuſed if the melancholicke haue appetite thereto. And generally of foule the carued is better, then the other. Of beaſtes the gelded haue preferment aboue their felowes of that kind: among them pigge is meet for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, farced with ſage and ſuch like art of cookerie, to dry vp part of his ſuperfluous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: veale, eſpecially of a cowe calfe, yong we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutton, kidde, &amp; rabbet are of the beſt kind of diet among the beaſts for melancholick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Of the pattes of fleſh: the brawnes and muſcles are the beſt, and next to them the tong is of ſecond choyce. Of liuers, the pigges liuer among beaſts is the beſt, &amp; the ſtones of cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells yeeld commendable nouriſhment. Of fleſh theſe aboue mentioned are moſt agreable with the diet cure of melancholie, &amp; ſuch parts of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I haue declared: the other either breeding
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:6813:144"/>a groſſe, or ſlimie nouriſhment hard of digeſtion and ſlowe of paſſage. Generally fiſh is not ſo wholſome as fleſh for this vſe, becauſe they be not ſo well ſtored with naturall heate and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, except the imbecillitie of the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtomach be ſuch as wil not beare the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of fleſh, then is the fiſh to be boyled with wine, and to be eaten out of ſome wholeſome broth, or with good ſtore of ſweet butter, and ſauoured with pepper. If the partie deſire fiſh, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are principall among them. And firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch as are of a middle bigneſſe, not too fat, nor leane, white, and brittle of ſubſtance, &amp; haunt the ſwifteſt and pureſt waters, are moſt commendable: for ſuch breed ſubtileſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and leaſt fraight with excrements. Of ſalt water fiſh that beare ſhells, the oyſter is only for this diet, of thoſe that are defended with a cruſt, the ſhrimp, and crayfiſh go before the reſt. Of other kind of ſeafiſh, ſuch as haunt the rockes are excellent food for melancholicke perſons, corrected and vſed as I haue before ſhewed: as the gilthead, the whiting, the ſea pearch &amp;c. Of other ſort the mullet, the lucie, the haddocke, the ſole, place, but, gurnard and rotchet are to be admitted into this diet. Of freſh water fiſh, thoſe of the riuer are to be preferred: &amp; the reſt ſcarſe to be touched, except they receaue corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the kitchin. Of riuer fiſh theſe are of the wholſomeſt kinde: pearch, pike, gougeon, &amp; trout. Thus of the ſubſtance of creatures you haue what I iudge meeteſt for you in this caſe. Of the other ſort, nothing is to be refuſed but
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:6813:144"/>cowmilke, all other ſorts carrying a thinner, and more liquid ſubſtance, and importing no perill of obſtruction, nor windineſſe:eſpeciallly taken with ſuger and a litle ſalt, &amp; two or three houres before any other ſuſtenance. As cow milk is the groſſeſt and thickeſt, ſo mares milke (except that of camels) is the thinneſt, next of aſſe, goats milke is moſt moderate, and ewes milke thicker then it. Of the partes of milke, whay drunke with ſuger is wholeſome for melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke folke, neither is freſh and new butter to be refuſed, cheeſe made altogether of cowe milke is vnwholſome, mixed with goats, or aſſes milk, maketh it not ſo apt to breed obſtructions. Eggs are good, and wholeſome ſuſtenance for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke bodies, roſted rather then ſod or pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and reare dreſſed ſomwhat the yelk thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then to be ſupped. Of egges, hens, feaſaunts, and turkies lay the wholeſomeſt egges, and are only for the melancholickes diſh. Thus much concerning the meates fit for their diet. Their dreſſing ought to be ſuch as may maintaine their naturall iuyce as much as may be, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of all rawneſſe. Their ſawces would be the iuyce of an orange or lymon, well qualified with ſuger and ſweet butter, eſpecially if vineger or veriuyce be part in ſauce, more in vineger, &amp; leſſe in veriuyce. Their drinke would be of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mault brued with raine water, or ſpring water which is much drawn of, next to theſe riuer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may take the third place of commendation. It would be of a midle ſtrength, &amp; not too ſtale: beare rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ale, becauſe the hops do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:6813:145"/>reſpect their liuer and ſplene, &amp; ſcoureth the ſtomach, and maketh purer, and readier way for diſtribution of their nouriſhment. It ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good for them to drinke at meales a draught of wine of good ſtrength: claret rather then white, and of any kind well refined, and full of wine. If they drinke their wine with ſuger, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth greater cheering to them, maketh it to paſſe more eaſily, and mitigateth their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke ſowreneſſe. Drinke betwixt meales, or after meate is to be auoyded, except great cauſe vrge. Hitherto their ſuſtenance, of what kinde it ought to be of, and among ſuch varietie of food, and ſo many good bleſſinges of God that way, what choyce is to be made: as for their order of eating, and drinking, and meaſure of both, as liquid meates and brothes are moſt conuenient for them, ſo I take it, they may drinke largely, (except ſome accident of the ſtomach diſſuade) By reaſon their digeſtion is ſlowe, my aduiſe is, they eate litle, and often: litle becauſe their ſtrength beareth not much, nor ſuch mediocrity as other men: often, becauſe their ſpirites are fewe, and neede repayring: beſides the colde, ſower, and ſetling humour of melancholie is to be refreſhed as much as may be, with freſh and pure nouriſhment, and to be tempered, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated with that ſweet and gentle mixture. The outward maintenance of life, and ſuſtentation of our fraile bodies conſiſt in houſe or habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; apparell, which both muſt carie theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be cleane and nete, and in all reſpects as much as may be ſatisfying the minde of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6813:145"/>For although meates and drinkes, and ayre, either vnwholeſome, or vnpleaſaunt beare great ſway in diſpoſing the humour, yet becauſe they haue not ſuch power to affect the minde and ſenſes as theſe other haue, in reſpect of the paſſion, and melancholike affection, they worke not ſo preſent annoyaunce. The houſe except it be cheerefull and lightſome, trimme and neate, ſeemeth vnto the melancholicke a priſon or dungeon, rather then a place of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured repoſe and reſt. And the apparell except it be light, cleane, fitte, and well ſitting, maketh ſhewe of deformitie, to the melancholicke, and being euer in his eye, is a repreſentation of his preſent calamitie, verie tedious vnto him, or if it be not ſo in his conceit, being nowe farre altered: yet agreing with the humour, it may be meanes of increaſe thereof, and augmenting the fancie. The ſituation of his houſe, or at the leaſt of his chamber, and place where he is moſt conuerſant, would be ſuch as might let in ſuch kinde of ayre as I haue before declared, &amp; ſeated neither too lowe in anie bottome, nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hill too high, except the melancholie be out of meaſure, ſadde and ſullen, then an high, loftie, and troubled ayre, and ſuch ſeate of houſe will not be amiſſe. If the melan cholicke be of abilitie, the houſe would not want or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of picture, of gay and freſh colours, in ſuch matter as ſhall be moſt pleaſaunt, and delightfull, and of all ornamentes of houſe, and home, a pleaſaunt gardin and hortyeard: with a liuelie ſpringe, is aboue all domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6813:146"/>call delight, &amp; meeteſt for the melancholy heart and brayne. His apparell would be decent and comely, and as the purſe will giue leaue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the time ſumptious, as alſo the whole houſhold furniture belonging vnto him. Of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, light, or chaungeable, except the place, &amp; grauity of the melancholy perſon refuſeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and here no kinde of ſeemely ornament would be omitted which might entice the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to delight, and allure the incloſed ſpirites to ſolace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the outward parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: here brouches, chaines, &amp; ringes may haue good vſe with ſuch like ornament of iewell as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the hability and calling of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke: and thoſe not onely curious, and pretious by arte, but eſpecially garniſhed with precious ſtones that are ſaid to haue vertue againſt vaine feares and baſenes of courage. Of which ſorte are theſe following: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle for vertue the chiefe of ſtones: The Calcedonye of power to put awaye feare and heauines of hearte, a cleerer of the Spirites, and chaſer away of fantaſticall melancholy viſions. The ruby auayleable againſt fearfull dreames. The lacint a great cheerer of the heart, and procurer of fauour. The Turcoyſe, a comforter of the Spirites. The Chryſophars of like vertue. The Corneole a mitigater of anger and meete for molancholickes of the furious ſorte. Stones of baſer ſorte and yet of ſinguler vertue, are the Chalydony, or ſwallow ſtone, found in the mawes of young ſwallowes, againſt madnes: and the Alectorian or Cockes ſtone, of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:6813:146"/>a watery colour, found in the mawe of a Cocke or Capon after he be nine yeares olde, aboue all commended for giuing ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and wherewith (as it is reported) the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Milo Crotonien alway ſtoode inuincible. Thus haue you the whole order of the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diet. I doe not remember any thing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and peculiar vnto them neceſſary, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bene hitherto declared, wherefore in the next chapter I will alſo lay open what phiſicke helpe is requiſite in this caſe, and ſo recommend the ſucceſſe and fruite of my labour to the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing of God vpon you, and ſuch as are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of like affliction. As for the furious melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, I leaue it to be cured as deſeaſe and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and will not meddle therewith in this place, being impertinent to my purpoſe, which reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth onely your eſtate, and ſuch like condition of others.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:6813:147"/>practiſe vpon this aduiſe, as the common ſorte is to venterous to attempt what they read of medicine deliuered in their vulgar toung, but that ſeing the manifold good meanes which god in his great prouidence, and mercy hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the releefe, you may take courage in the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his goodnes herein, and receiue refreſhing by the view of his aide though it be a farre of, which the diſcreete application of the wiſe phiſicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (who is made of God for the health of men) ſhall bringe nigh vnto you, and ioyning with this ſtrength of melancholy, chaſe it farre from you, and render vnto you the former good diſpoſition of your body, and deſired tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of your minde. For medicine is like a toole &amp; inſtrument of the ſharpeſt edge, which not wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided, nor handled with that cunning which thereto appertaineth, may bringe preſent perill in ſteade of health, and where it ſhould be a ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and maintenance of life, for want of arte, may worke a contrary effect, daungerous, and deadly. To the right applying of medicine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the particular conſiderations belonging properly to the arte of phiſicke wherein exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe maketh the phiſician prompt and expert, ſharpe of iudgement, and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect in the cure, you your ſelfe know what furniture of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie is neceſſary, euen the whole courſe of arts, and knowledge of nature, but onely to prepare, and to giue hability, of conceiuing, and learning the rules of preſeruing and reſtoring the health of mans body, which we call phiſicke: ſo that as Galen ſayeth in a booke of that title, a phiſician
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:6813:147"/>ought to be a philoſopher, the beſt philoſopher maketh the beſt phiſician, neither ought any to be admitted to touch ſo holy thinges, that hath not paſſed the whole diſcipline of liberall ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and waſhed himſelfe pure and cleane in the waters of wiſedome, and vnderſtanding.

That (as I am perſwaded) there are not ſo many honeſt and painefull men of any one trade in the lande, as their be lewde couſoning varletts, that to auoide the trauaile of honeſt labour, feede vpon the ſimplicitie of the people, and make the pretence of phiſicke the cloake of their idlenes.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:6813:148"/>and vpon the view of theſe manifold meanes of bodely health: conſider how much more the Lords prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ready at all neede, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort our ſoules, in ſo much as the one is far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the other. Thus hauing giuen this warning I proceed to deliuer the naturall helps and ordinarie remedies we doe vſe in this caſe wherein your bodely health now ſtandeth. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what outward cauſes are to be remoued, and what to be brought in ſtead of them, contrary in operation, and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a better tempered humour. The next conſideration (according to the method of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) is to be had of ſuch inward cauſe as reſteth in the body, and hath bene the effect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward annoyance: that is here the melancholick humour, and complexion of the bodie now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated thereby. The humour requireth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacuation, and emptying: and becauſe your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not only melancholicke vnder the ribbes but the whole maſſe of your blood is chaunged therewith: it ſhall be firſt neceſſarye to open a vaine: that both thereby you may be disburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in parte of that heauy load, and nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing leſſe of that kinde to deale withall, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the remnant into a more milde and pleaſant iuice: thinne it in ſubſtance, and temper it with naturall heate and moiſture: in quality. Before any vaine be opened a cliſter is firſt to be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that may clenſe the entrailes and diminiſh ſome part of the humour ſeated in thoſe parts, it wold be made of marſhmallowes, holyhockes, pelletory of the wale, mercurie, beetes, aretch,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:6813:149"/>violet leaues, polipody, borrage, bugloſſe, cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, hoppes, dill, and melilote, anniſe ſeeds, and fennell, decocted in ale or beere: and the decoction being made, an ounce of Confectio hamech with a drame of Hiera pichra added thereto. Hony wherein roſemarye flowers haue bene ſteeped, and oyle of dill of ech an ownce and a halfe, this or ſuch like according to the diſcretion of the learned phiſicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning following the vaines are to be emptied the neceſſity of the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> compared with the force and ſtrength which moderateth all kinde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though the deſeaſe require large emp tying. And becauſe melandcholy blood is thicke and groſſe, &amp; therfore eaſily floweth not though the vaine be opened, it ſhall helpe the bleeding to exerciſe your body a while before with ſuch moderation that it be equally warmed, and the ſpirite, and blood ſtirred vp. The Orifice would be ſomewhat large that no lett be to the iſſue, &amp; the groſſenes of the blood may haue the free paſſage: yet ſo that it be no larger then is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, for waſting of ſpirits wherof mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue no ſtore to ſpare. In the body the mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle vaine of the left arme is fitteſt to be opened, which, reſpecteth, both head, liuer, and ſplene: that betwixt the little finger and the next is of ſmall vſe. In ſuch as haue the adduſt melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated in their brains, the head vaine is more direct for reuulſion, and thoſe about the head it ſelfe for euacuating and deriuing. The tokens of ſeating there only, are with altered fancie and imagination, the bodie elſe carying no melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:6813:149"/>ſignes, no ſower belching after meate, nor heate with windineſſe, which all riſe of the melancholy humour ſtopping the meſaraicke vaines, and ſo procuring that vnnaturall &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focating heate, which many melancholick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons complaine of. The quantitie which I would haue you ſpare, let it be no leſſe then nine or ten ownces, except the preſent action of opening miniſter other conſideration. Nowe becauſe you haue had in times paſt the benefite of bleeding hemorhods, which now a long time are ſtopped at ſuch ſeaſons as they were wont to open, or now when they giue any ſigne of fulneſſe, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or paine, they would alſo be opened by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a redde onion to the place, or annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with the iuyce of garlicke, or with bulles gall, or rubbing it with a figge leafe, or with horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches well purged, and prepared, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the eaſieſt way: by opening the inwarde vaines of the ankle &amp; ſuch like remedies as may prouoke the bloud his vſuall way, and bring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in minde of her wonted diſcharge of that humour, which being ſtopped breedeth (as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates ſaith, and experience maketh proofe) frenſies, melancholies, pleuriſies, hard milts, &amp; dropſies: and contrarily opened, &amp; flowing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly, deliuereth from them all. If this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly falleth vnto maidens, or women, &amp; their ordinarie courſe faile them, the vaines of the hammes or ancles are to be cut, and drinkes of opening rootes, fenell, perſly, butchers brome, madder, and ſuch like, with germander, goolds, herbe grace, mugwort and nep are to be much
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:6813:150"/>vſed, with ſittinges and bathinges in mallowes, chammomile and nep, peniroyall, bay leaues, fetherfew (and ſuch like, which haue vertue in that caſe) decocted in water, wherein ſo much honie hath bene diſſolued, as will giue it a taſt of ſweetneſſe: if greater force be required then a dramme of the troches of myrre in the former decoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are moſt forcible, the opening of vaine before mentioned would be procured at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed time, at the full mone in the elder ſort, and the chaunge in the yonger. The thicker the bloud is, the more the melancholick may ſpare, and the thinner, the leſſe. Thus much I iudge neceſſarie for one kind of euacuation, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it letteth out good bloud withall (as in all bleeding) yet here lyeth the benefit, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is partly disburthened, and ſo more eaſilie gouerneth the reſt, and by vertue of her natural heate, and ſpirit, correcteth with ſmaller helpe that which therin is farther to be reformed, the ſpirites haue free libertie, and great ſcope is giuen to the harts dilating, the action peculiar to a cheerfull diſpoſition. The other kinde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacation is by purging: which leaueth the bloud entrie, only it cleanſeth the bodie of that groſſe and thicke ſettelinge, and is more peculiar, and directly ſingleth out the melancholie from the other humours: and becauſe this humour is thicke, and hardly moueth, and the paſſages, &amp; veines of the body cloſer then whereby it may eaſily paſſe, (according to Hipocrates rule) both bodie and humour are to receaue a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the parts of the body to be looſened,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6813:150"/>and enlarged, &amp; the humor made more flowing and thinne, both which may be brought to paſſe with one meanes at once: by choyce of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as haue vertue of attenuating, opening, &amp; cleanſing: and becauſe the cure is not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the melancholicke humour, and that complexion of body, but alſo againſt the fancy, and affection, which we call in phiſicke ſymptomes, alwayes choice would be made of ſuch as carrie with them proprietie to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the altered braine, and to cheere the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hart: or if that cannot be found in one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is to be ſupplied by mixture. Their temper would be moderate in heat, except the naturall temper of the body, time of yeare, ſex &amp;c. (and ſuch like conſiderations) perſwade on either ſide any declination. The ſimples meete for this preparation of body, &amp; humour are theſe which follow: borrage, bugloſſe, endiue, fumitory, hops, betony, the ſorts of maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haire, ceterach, harts tong, polypody, doddar of thime, agrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cich peaſe, aſh barks, caper barks, tamarisk, to which would be added opening roots, fenell, perſley, ſmallage, butchers broome, aſparagus, and ſuch like. Of theſe ſimples decoctions ſhold be made, and mixed with ſyrops of like vertue, as with ſyrope of borrage, of apples, ſimple, or compound, as that of King Sabor, ſyrope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory, ſyrope of violets, of ceterach, ſyrope of epithymus or doddar of thime: all openers of ſplene and liuer, cleanſers of the bloud, &amp; great preparers to the purging both of bodie, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: the vſe of them would be much, &amp; often
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:6813:151"/>faſting that they may haue their ful force. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to this vſe a kind of beare, brued with the ſimples before mentioned, and ſome ſmall reliſh of cloues and cynamon giuen vnto it: &amp; ſo vſed as ordinary drinke would be very wholſome for melancholick perſons: and now and then if the ſtomach be raw &amp; rheumatick, a draught of hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocras, or ſome aromaticall wine giueth great comfort, increaſeth the ſpirits, and maketh the bloud thinne. But here heede muſt be giuen that it be not too ſtrong of ſpice, leaſt through too much heate, by euaporatinge the thinne part, the reſt of the bloud remaine more thicke, and harder to be purged. Beſides theſe inwarde preparations, and opening and thinning po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the liuer, and the ſplene, and the partes vnder the ribs would be ſuppled with conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient fomentations and oyntmentes, to ſoften to open, &amp; to looſen thoſe parts where the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging medicin hath moſt to do: this may be done with fomentations made of mallowes, chammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, melilot, figges, lineſeede, fetherfew, rewe, and roſe leaues, red and damaske, and the part being a while ſupplied therwith, ſome mollfying and warming ointment is to be rubbed &amp; chafed in gently, with a ſoft hand: as that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly reſumptiuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the oyntment of brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the ointment of ſwines bread called cycla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vpon which if need be a plaiſter of like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may haue very good vſe, as diachylum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, the emplaiſter of melilote for the ſplene: ceroneum, diamelilotum of Andramachus &amp;c. to theſe preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; diſpoſings of body, &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:6813:151"/>to the purging. If it ſeme good vnto the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; for varietie, baths would be vſed of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying &amp; moderatly warming ſimples, as of mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, marſh mallowes, holihock, chammomile, melilot, peniroyall, lineſeed, roſes, &amp;c. In which decoction lukewarme, the body is to be kept half an houre at a time (or as preſent occaſion ſhall direct) faſting, &amp; in the while the partes vnder the ſhort ribbes ſuppled &amp; exerciſed with a ſoft hand, anointed with oyle of capers: oile of bitter alomonds, &amp; a fewe drops of petroleum mixed therwith. After the body hath bin thus prepared &amp; the humour ſomwhat more looſe, &amp; eaſie to moue: purgation is next to be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted: by ſtoole rather then by vomit, except the party be verie apt therunto, and the melancholy be chiefly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therabout. The ſimples proper to purge me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy are theſe following: Sena, polypodie, blacke hellebore, and white, the azure ſtone, and more gentle then it, the Armenian ſtone, all which diligently prepared and corrected, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in quantity meet for the patients ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth enter combat with this humor, &amp; with ſuch force chaſeth it out of the body, that it followeth it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the ſtoole. The compounds are diaſena confectio hamech: hieralogadion: pils of fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Inde of the azure, and Armenian ſtone, in which the ſimples before mentioned receaue their correction, &amp; due preſeruation, farre more ſafe to be vſed then the ſimple alone, all which purgers are to be receiued &amp; mingled with ſome moyſting decoction, as of barley, with borrage, bugloſſe, violet leaues, &amp; ſyrope of violetets, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:6813:152"/>bugloſſe &amp;c. if they be electuaries, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; if they be pils, a thin broth, drunke imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after them, that both the liquid ſubſtance may giue a ſpeedy conueyance, &amp; the dry humor ſoked with that forme of medicine, may more gently yeeld, &amp; giue place to the purge. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the medicine is felt now to haue paſſed the ſtomach which is perceaued that it yeeldeth no medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable taſt to the mouth, by belching or breath, then ſome broth may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made of ſuch kind of fleſh &amp; herbs as haue bene before mentioned, and ſo (till the working ceaſe) the whole action of the medicine to be endured. Thus much for purging by ſtoole: if vomit be thought more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, (as I iudge it very neceſſarie in you) whatſoeuer emptieth the ſtomach by prouoking nature that way (except the matter be very hard to moue, &amp; deep ſetled) ſhall ſuffiſe for that ſort of euacuation. Vomit is very neceſſary when the ſtomach is moiſt &amp; watery, and maketh ſhewe therof by much ſpitting, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the patient is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſoure belching, and when the meate is perceaued (in mouing of the body) to be looſe, &amp; iogge in the ſtomach: then I ſay all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring together, vomit is to be vſed: firſt of the gentle ſort: of which kinde are radiſh roots, &amp; ſeeds, pompeon root, netle ſeed, aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backa root or leafe &amp;c. if the cauſe &amp; ſtrength of the melancholick require a greater force of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, Stibium, &amp; white hellebore are ſingular in this caſe: which both would be miniſtred in fat broth: the ſubſtance of Stibium, &amp; the infuſion of neeſing powder or white helleborus: being in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6813:152"/>ſubſtance moſt daungerous. This kind of helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore more helpeth the fancy, and correcteth the braine, and the other more dealeth with the humour, &amp; both diſcretly vſed performe a moſt wholſome euacuation. If the melancholicke do labour much in vomiting, miniſter drinke or thin broth, ſo ſhall the vomit be with more eaſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. All perturbation of the bodie being ended, &amp; the medicine hauing wrought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect, the face is to be refreſhed with ſome mixture of roſewater, and vineger, and roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to be ſmelled vnto, the mouth to be waſhed and ſome conſerue of red roſes, with a quarter ſo much of quince preſerued, and one drop of oyle of cloues, or cynamon, would be receaued to ſtrengthen the ſtomach againe, to ſettle it quiet, &amp; if any quality of the medicine remaine to correct &amp; alter it, what ſoeuer therby the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſhould feele of diſcontentment. This em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying of ſtoole &amp; vomit, is ſo often to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; by ſuch diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time, as need requireth: the ſtrength of the melancholick will beare, and the humor admitteth of preparation: eſpecially the ſpring &amp; fall craue this emptying at large.</p>

In the meane while of this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and purging: both in reſpect of the fancy, of the brayne, and affection of the hearte, and the complexion of both, put out of frame by the humour, theſe two are chiefely to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, with cordialls, and medicines appropriate.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick patient, (among whome I accompt you the ſubiect of this my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell) nature muſt haue a time and reſpit giuen, to try her owne ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, according to the counſell of Ruphus, and not to be tiered with medicine, the diet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding being kept diligently which hath bin preſcribed and all kinde of honeſt exerciſe, and recreation practiſed &amp; procured. If the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly be aduſt, (which it is not in you) then breedeth it a kinde of fury, and madnes, and requireth a cooling: &amp; perticular conſideration: whereof (becauſe it is very rare in reſpect of the other kinde, &amp; ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into the rancke of euident deſeaſe) I minde not here to diſcourſe being only willing thus far to ſatiſfie your deſire, wherein your caſe (&amp; ſuch as are in like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with you,) require it. If any accidentes befall you through this infirmity, of hardnes of body you may vſe the cliſter before mentioned without the purging medicines, with three ownces of oyle, and as much of hony: or you may take an handefull of mallowes, holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, violet leaues, beete, and fetherfew, anniſe ſeedes, or fennell ſeedes halfe an ounce beaten with an handfull of courſe where branne tied in a linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cloth &amp; boyled in thinne whay: to a pint of which being ſtrained, adde oyle, and honie, with halfe a ſpoonefull of ſalt: and receiue it for a cliſter: or drinke faſting a ſpoonefull or twayne of ſweete ſallet oyle in a draught of whaye:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:6813:155"/>or eate a quarter of an ownce of conſerue of damaske roſes, with xxx. graines of the pureſt ſalt peter, and drinke it: and eſpecially let your broathes alwayes haue ſome ſoluble hearbes, that may giue you that benefite, as mallowes, violettes, mercurie, aretch, beetes and ſuch like. If your ſleepe fayle you through vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of cogitation, and feare: let your hands and feete be waſhed with the decoction of dill, chammomill, lettice, poppie mallowes, and willowe leaues: and annointe them with oyle of poppie ſeedes made by expreſſion: or take a dramme of Mithridate, fiue graines of Opium three of ſaffron, with a ſpoonefull of malmeſey, and a graine or two of Camphire: put all into a limon pill emptied of the iuice, and ſmell to it often about your ordinary hower of ſleep: which meanes if they bring not the deſired effect, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low twenty graines of the piles of Cynogloſſe, or take halfe a dramme of Philomum going to bed for other ſome other wholeſome opiats me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine well corrected. If your body be much troubled with winde (as it is for the moſt part a companion of this kinde of melancholy:) yee muſt vſe a fomentation to your ſtomach bellie and partes about the ſhort ribbes with oyle and malmeſey wherein rue, fennell, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mine, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe ſeedes, and hearbs haue bene boyled, and inwardly you are to take faſting Deatrion pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion, diaciminu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or diagalanga the quantitie of a nutmegge at a time: and now and then cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath of gummes, with oyle of mints, and rue, worne vpon thoſe partes, ſhall be of great force
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:6813:155"/>to waſt the winde, to warme them, and to giue them ſtrength. Thus my friende <hi>M.</hi> haue you my whole counſell, what I iudge meete for you in this caſe, my philoſophicall diſcourſes to paſſe your time with, who hath alwayes delighted in philoſophie: my conſolation in reſpect of that Chriſtian duety which I owe you, wherein if I haue ſo buſied my ſelfe, that my care that waye hath exceeded my power, &amp; hability, ſo eſteeme it, and ſo meaſure that diſcharge. My phiſicke, cure: of diet, of preparation of your body, of eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, of ſtrengthening, of correcting, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of certaine troubleſome accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that fall to this humour, it is not ſo copious, and abſolute as peraduenture may fitte your eſtate, &amp; leaue no queſtion of doubt, but (if I miſtake not the caſe very much) for ſubſtance and grounde of the cure you ſhall nor neede to make farther inquirie Although I remember your trauaile in philoſophie, and ſtudie of phiſick, to which both you haue had a naturall diſpoſition, and take pleaſure in reading our writinges of precept &amp; rule take aduiſe of ſome learned, and vertuous phiſician about you, and aduenture not vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of euacuation without his direction: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you haue this as a touchſtone to proue the skill of ſuch lewde people as at this day are impudently bold with the hurte of others, to deceiue boaſting, &amp; lying, and couering the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of their vnderſtanding, with gorgeous wordes, and rich pompe of phraſe: otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as empty of knowledge as they be quite void of all vertue and honeſty. I ſay let it be a rule to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:6813:156"/>ſquare and try them by: and if ſuch knowledge (whereof here you may haue the taſt) be nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary in an infirmity of no perill of life (though it make it tedious, and irkeſome) what aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and care is to be had whome to call for, &amp; what phiſician to make choice of in deſeaſes full of daunger, ſharp, and ſwift, and whoſe cure (if art be not in all pointes perfourmed) is not without leauing ſuch ſcar, that no rebating, no deterſiue medicine is able to pare &amp; wipe away the blemiſh: not an eye ſore, but a maime, and fixed imbecillitie in ſtomach, in braine, in hart, or liuer, nor that by natures error, or by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie breach of diet which are more gentle, but through an outward violence and force, againſt which nature hath no skill to helpe it ſelfe, nor power to reſiſt. As I giue you this warning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, ſo whoſoeuer ſhall reape any fruit of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour taken in hand for your ſake, let them alſo take this admonition from me, rather then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with their own hurt, &amp; expence, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; diſcipline which experience bringeth. Thus my good <hi>M.</hi> with this caueat, I commend the bleſſing &amp; ſucceſſe of my labour to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who reſtore you if it be his will ſound in bodie, cheerfull in mind, and aſſured in faith of his ſweete mercie and fauour.</p>
